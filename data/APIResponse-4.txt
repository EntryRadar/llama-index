      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and effect of pimasertib in combination with bintrafusp alfa in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases). Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the monoclonal antibody anti-PD-L1 and TGF-beta, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pimasertib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pimasertib and bintrafusp alfa may help to prevent or delay the cancer from progressing (getting worse) and/or coming back.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Establish safety profile and recommended phase II dose for combining pimasertib with bintrafusp alfa (M7824) in patients with brain metastases. (Phase I) II. Time to intracranial progression (defined as progression of existing lesions and development of new lesions by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1). (Phase II) III. Overall survival. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Intracranial progression 6, 12 and 18 months. II. Intracranial objective response rate as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM), immunotherapy (i)RANO, and RECIST 1.1.

III. Time to second intracranial progression after salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

IV. Overall survival rate at 6, 12 and 18 months. V. Frequency of grade 3+ intracranial toxicities at 4 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months.

VI. Frequency of extracranial progression and response rate at 8 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months.

VII. Frequency of neurocognitive decline at 6, 12 and 18 months (optional). VIII. Changes in neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life. IX. Dose, duration and frequency of steroid use for symptomatic management.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify molecular and/or immunological markers from biospecimens (tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) that are associated with treatment response and toxicity.

II. Identify imaging biomarkers of response and toxicity (acute radiation effect/radionecrosis and neurocognitive changes) from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or delayed positron emission tomography (PET) that predict treatment response and toxicity.

III. Identify correlative or surrogative relationship between systemic (blood) and imaging markers and treatment outcomes.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of followed by a phase II dose-expansion study.

Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks and pimasertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 6 weeks during year 1, and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>The objective of this project is to identify effective strategies to help patients with lung cancer manage side effects and achieve optimal adherence to oral targeted therapies. To achieve this objective, we will evaluate the effect of a novel, bidirectional conversational agent, compared to usual care, on adherence to oral targeted therapies using a two-arm randomized controlled trial, and explore how multilevel factors impact the acceptability and effectiveness of this strategy by collecting qualitative and quantitative data from clinicians and patients.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Drawing from insights in behavioral economics and implementation science, the goal of our project is to identify effective strategies for improving lung cancer outcomes by helping patients to better manage symptoms and adhere to oral therapies. Given the rapid increase in FDA-approved targeted therapies, the need for such strategies will continue to grow. Our central hypothesis is that conversational agent will improve adherence to oral therapies by targeting patient-level determinants of behavior change. The specific aims are to: 1) Test the effects of a patient-directed intervention (conversational agent) to improve adherence to oral targeted therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.; and 2) Use mixed-methods approaches with clinicians and patients to explore multilevel factors shaping the acceptability, effectiveness, and future implementation of intervention into routine cancer care. Primary trial outcomes (adherence and persistence) will be measured using microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using longitudinal surveys and medical record data.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of intrathecal nivolumab, and how well it works in combination with intravenous nivolumab in treating patients with leptomeningeal disease. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the safety and/or recommended dose of intrathecal (IT) nivolumab in combination with systemic nivolumab treatment in melanoma and lung cancer with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess overall survival with combined intrathecal and systemic administration of nivolumab in this patient population.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Compare the immunological effects of this treatment on immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to those observed in the peripheral blood and in non-LMD tumors.

II. Evaluation of predictors (clinical, molecular, and/or immune) of the efficacy and safety of this regimen.

III. To assess the effect of nivolumab on subsequent treatment. IV. To compare levels of nivolumab in the CSF and peripheral blood.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase Ib study.

Patients receive nivolumab IT over 5 minutes on day 1 of every cycle. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 (4 hours after the IT dose). Cycles repeat every 14 days for 18 cycles and then every 28 days (cycles 19 and beyond) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will have CSF and blood specimen collection on days 1, 2, 8 of each cycle and end of treatment. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline, cycle 5 and then every 8 weeks. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, cycles 3, 5, and then every 8 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</FieldValue>

Women are eligible to participate if:

Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]
A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level &gt; 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause

Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is &gt;40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:

1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months
A Women of childbearing potential agrees to use method(s) of contraception. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product
Women must not be breastfeeding
Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year The investigator shall review contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. Therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug
Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).

        <FieldValue>A Study of ASP1002 in Adults for Treatment of Solid Tumors</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>ASP1002 is a potential new treatment for people with certain solid tumors. Before ASP1002 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how it is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and check for potential medical problems from the treatment.

People in this study will be adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with high levels of a protein called claudin 4. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They will have been previously treated with available standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.

There are 2 main aims of this study. One is to learn if people with certain solid tumors have any medical problems or side effects after receiving different doses of ASP1002. The other is to find a suitable dose of ASP1002 to use in future studies.

This study will be in 2 parts.

In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP1002. Any medical problems and side effects will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP1002 to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP1002. A medical expert panel will check the results from this group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP1002. The panel will do this for each dose group until all groups have taken ASP1002 or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.

In Part 2, other different small groups of people will receive ASP1002 with the most suitable doses determined from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP1002 to use in future studies.

During both parts of the study, ASP1002 will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long and the infusion is given weekly. People in this study will continue treatment for up to 2 years (32 cycles) until: they have medical problems or side effects that prevent them from continuing treatment; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; they ask to stop treatment; they do not come back for treatment.

People will visit the clinic several times during each treatment cycle. They will receive ASP1002 infusions 3 times during each treatment cycle. Each infusion could take 15 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the dose. In addition to infusions, other checks will occur during the visit. During these visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. At some visits, other checks will include a medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Vital signs include temperature, pulse, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Also, blood and urine samples will be taken. Tumor samples will be taken during certain visits during treatment and when treatment has finished.

People will visit the clinic within 7 days after stopping treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. Other checks will include a medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Then, they may visit the clinic at 30 days (1 month) and 90 days (3 months) after stopping treatment. At the 30-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. People will have their vital signs checked and have some laboratory tests. At the 90-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002 and people will have their vital signs checked. After this, people will continue to visit the clinic every 9 to 12 weeks. This is to check the condition of their cancer.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Study of TSR-042, an Anti-programmed Cell Death-1 Receptor (PD-1) Monoclonal Antibody, in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a multi-center, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating the anti-programmed death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody dostarlimab (also known as TSR-042) n participants with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts with Part 1 consisting of safety evaluation, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PDy) of escalating doses of dostarlimab. Dose escalation will be based on ascending weight-based dose levels (DLs) of dostarlimab and will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or may be stopped at any dose level up to the highest dose of 20 milligrams per kilograms (mg/kg) based on emerging safety and PK/PDy data. Part 2 will be conducted in two subparts, Part 2A (fixed-dose safety evaluation cohorts) and Part 2B (expansion cohorts). Part 2A of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of dostarlimab at fixed doses of 500 mg administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 1000 mg administered every 6 weeks (Q6W). Part 2B of the study will examine the safety and clinical activity of dostarlimab in cohorts of participants with specific types of advanced solid tumors.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>Inclusion Criteria:

Participant is at least 18 years of age.
Participant has proven recurrent or advanced solid tumor and has disease progression after treatment with available anti cancer therapies, or is intolerant to treatment that meets the following requirements for the part of the study they will participate in:
a. Part 1: Any histologically or cytologically proven recurrent advanced solid tumor
b. Part 2A: : Any histologically or cytologically proven recurrent advanced solid tumor
c. Part 2B: Histologically of cytologically proven recurrent or advanced solid tumor with measurable lesion(s) per RECIST version 1.1 and meets one of the following disease types:
The criteria below should be met for participant participating in: Cohort A1 (dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer) and Cohort A2 (MMR-proficient/MSS endometrial cancer)
Participants who have progressed on or after platinum doublet therapy
Participants have received no more than 2 lines of anti-cancer therapy for recurrent or advanced (&gt;=Stage IIIB) disease. Prior treatment with hormone therapies is acceptable and does not count towards the number of anti-cancer therapies noted in the criterion above for this cohort.
All endometrial cancer histologies are allowed except endometrial sarcoma (including carcinosarcoma).
Participants must submit 2 scans demonstrating increase in tumor measurement that meet criteria for PD on or after the latest systemic anti-cancer therapy based on RECIST Version 1.1 to Central Radiology prior to the first dose of dostarlimab.
Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion on Baseline scan will be confirmed by central radiology review.
Status of tumor MMR/MSI: Participants can be screened based on local MMR/MSI testing results using immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or next generation sequencing (NGS) performed in a certified local laboratory, but participant eligibility needs to be determined by MMR IHC results. For participant with available local MMR IHC results for the respective cohort(s), tumor samples have to be submitted to a central IHC laboratory and its quality has to be checked and cleared prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). For participants without available local MMR IHC test results (participants with local PCR or NGS test results), central IHC results have to confirm eligibility prior to proceeding with other screening procedures. After the central IHC test is completed, remaining tumor tissue may be tested for further exploratory biomarkers or may be sent to a central NGS laboratory for further testing.
Cohort E - Participants with NSCLC who progressed after at least 1 prior platinum-based systemic chemotherapy regimen for recurrent or advanced disease. Chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting following surgery and/or radiation is acceptable if recurrent or advanced disease develops within 6 months from completion of therapy.
Participants with a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation must have received a chemotherapy regimen and an EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or experimental)
Participants with a known anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation must have received a chemotherapy regimen and an ALK inhibitor (e.g., crizotinib, ceritinib or experimental)
Cohort F - Participants with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H solid tumors except endometrial cancers and gastrointestinal cancers, who have received prior systemic therapy and who have no alternative treatment options. Prior treatment with hormone therapies alone given for recurrent or advanced disease is acceptable and does not count towards the number of anti-cancer therapies.
Measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 Radiology on baseline scan will be confirmed by central radiology review prior to first dose of dostarlimab. Patients with primary CNS tumor should provide brain MRI at baseline.
a. Presence of deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and/or microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in the tumor defined by either:
b. deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR); MMR status must be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR protein expression (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) where loss of one or more proteins indicates dMMR; dMMR may be determined either locally or by the central reference lab; OR
c. Microsatelillite instability (MSI-H); MSI-H as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by tissue Next generation sequencing (NGS); MSI-H may be determined locally
Cohort G: Participants must have recurrent high-grade serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Participants must have presence of at least 1 measurable lesion on Baseline scan that will be confirmed by central radiology review.
Participants must be considered resistant to the last administered platinum therapy, that is, the time from the last administered platinum dose until the initial documented progression (as evidenced by radiographic progression per RECIST version 1.1) must be less than 6 months.
Participants must have completed at least 1 but no more than 3 prior lines of therapy for advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer. Neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and the combination of both will be considered as 1 line of therapy. Treatment with single-agent bevacizumab given as maintenance is not counted as a separate line of therapy. If a therapeutic regimen is modified or changed for a reason other than lack of response or PD (such as allergic reaction, toxicity, or drug availability), this is not counted as a separate line of therapy. The use of single-agent hormonal therapy given for reasons other than PD per RECIST version v1.1 (i.e., hormonal therapy given for increasing Cancer antigen [CA]-125 levels) is not counted as a separate line of therapy.
Participants must have been previously treated with platinum-based regimen, taxane agent(s), and bevacizumab (bevacizumab could be used as a single agent or in combination with another agent, in frontline therapy, as maintenance, or for treatment of recurrent disease).
Part 2B: Participants must have archival tumor tissue available that is formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
For participants who do not have archival tissue, a new biopsy must be performed to obtain a tissue sample prior to study treatment initiation. For participants without available archival tissue, the biopsy should be taken from the tumor lesions (either primary or metastatic) that have easy accessibility and low biopsy-associated risks and will exclude biopsies of the liver, brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach or bowel.
For Cohort F an FFPE tissue sample must be submitted to the central laboratory for testing. For patients with available local MMR/MSI-H results, tumor samples have to be submitted to a central laboratory and its quality has to be checked and cleared prior to C1D1
For Cohort G, participant must provide formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block(s) with sufficient tumor content (as confirmed by the Sponsor's designated central laboratory) during screening to enable, for example, measures of homologous recombination pathway defects and PD-L1 status. The use of slides created from paraffin-embedded tissue as opposed to FFPE blocks must be approved by the Sponsor.
Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the date of the first dose of study medication: unless they are of non-child bearing potential.
Non child bearing potential is defined as: &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for &gt; 1 year; Amenorrheic for &lt; 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and have a follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pre-study (screening) evaluation. Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.
Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective form of contraception with their partner starting with the screening visit through 150 days after the last dose of study therapy.
Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;= 2 for Part 1 and &lt;= 1 for Part 2.
Participant has an adequate organ function.

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a Phase 1 multi-center study to evaluate the clinical safety and immune response of ID-LV305 when injected intradermally in patients with advanced cancer. ID-LV305 is a novel immunotherapy agent designed to target dendritic cells and stimulate the body's immune system to fight the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1 protein. Patients with melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, or small cell lung cancer that express NY-ESO-1 may be considered for the trial. Selected sites will be evaluating ID-LV305 with pembrolizumab for patients with melanoma who have inadequately responded to anti-PD-1 therapy.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>ID-LV305 is an agent designed to specifically target dendritic cells within the patient and induce them to stimulate and generate cytotoxic T cell responses against the NY-ESO-1 protein, a molecule which is often expressed in certain types of cancer cells. This is a first in human study of ID-LV305. The primary purpose of the study is to determine what dose ID-LV305 can be given safely to patients with advanced cancers that express NY-ESO-1 protein. ID-LV305 will be administered by intradermal injection every three weeks times four doses. The study will have two phases. In Part 1, Dose Escalation, which has been completed, three sequentially enrolled cohorts of patients were treated at one of four dose levels of ID-LV305 using a standard escalation design. Followed by Part 2 expansion where an additional 27 subjects were enrolled. In Part 2SA, Site-specific Amendment, patients with unresectable and/or metastatic melanoma with an inadequate response to anti-PD-1 MAb therapy, defined as SD or PD using RECIST criteria following at least 2 months of therapy. Patients with PD have a tumor measurement increase of &lt;2-fold from the time of starting anti-PD-1 therapy, must not be symptomatic or have worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status due to their disease progression, and cannot have new CNS lesion. Patients must also meet the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), ECOG status, and no tumor size criteria are used in Part 2SA.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The drug being tested is TAK-659.This study will look at the determination of the MTD/RP2D and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab. The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1), a potential nivolumab fixed dose cohort, and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors
Potential Nivolumab Fixed Dose Cohort
Part 2: Metastatic TNBC
Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC
Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC

All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately 12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS follow-up of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS follow-up of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>A Study to Test the Effect of the Drug Larotrectinib in Adults and Children With NTRK-fusion Positive Solid Tumors</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This research study is done to test how well different types of cancer respond to the drug called larotrectinib. The cancer must have a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). Larotrectinib is a drug that blocks the actions of these NTRK genes in cancer cells and can therefore be used to treat cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of larotrectinib for the treatment of advanced solid tumors harboring a fusion of neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) of types 1-3 in children and adults.

Secondary objectives comprise the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in different NTRK-tumor types.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>Inclusion Criteria:

Locally-advanced or metastatic malignancy with an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion, identified through molecular assays as routinely performed at CLIA or other similarly-certified laboratories. Subjects who have an NTRK gene fusion identified in a lab where CLIA or equivalent certification cannot be confirmed by the Sponsor at the time of consent may have been enrolled in Cohort 9 as per protocol versions 1.0 - 8.0. From protocol version 9.0: CLIA or similar certification of the lab performing the fusion assay is required. However, patients may be included after discussion with the sponsor if the lab performing the fusion assay is not CLIA or similar certified.
Subjects who have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease, or who have no satisfactory alternative treatments and in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy.

Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). Subjects with solid tumors without RECIST v1.1 measurable disease (e.g., evaluable disease only) had been eligible for enrollment to Cohort 8 as per protocol versions 1.0 - 8.0, regardless of tumor type. Subjects with primary CNS tumors should meet the following criteria:

Have received prior treatment including radiation and/or chemotherapy, with radiation completed &gt; 12 weeks prior to C1D1 of therapy, as recommended or appropriate for that CNS tumor type.
Have ≥ 1 site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and evaluable by RANO criteria), with the size of at least one of the measurable lesions ≥ 1 cm in each dimension and noted on more than one imaging slice.
Imaging study performed within 28 days before enrollment. If on steroid therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 7 days immediately before and during the imaging study.

Must be neurologically stable based on stable neurologic exam for 7 days prior to enrollment.

For subjects eligible for enrollment to bone health cohort, inclusion criterion 3 is modified as the following:

Subjects must have at least one lesion at baseline (measurable or non-measurable as defined by RECIST v1.1 or RANO criteria, as appropriate to tumor type).
Subjects with primary CNS tumors must be neurologically stable based on stable neurologic exam for 7 days prior to enrollment.
At least 18 years of age
Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≤ 3. If enrolled with primary CNS tumor to be assessed by RANO, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 50%.
Tumor tissue before treatment (mandatory). If neither fresh tissue can be obtained nor archival tissue is available patients might be enrolled after consultation with the sponsor.

Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

Serum AST and serum ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT &lt; 5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy
Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN, except in the setting of biliary obstruction. Subjects with a known history of Gilberts Disease and an isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin are eligible
Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 x ULN OR an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/minute using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: (140- age) x body weight (kg) x 0.85 (if female)/serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 with either result acceptable for enrollment.
Ability to comply (or for guardian to ensure compliance) with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring, and required clinic visits for the duration of study participation.
Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to use double effective birth control methods, defined as one used by the subject and another by his/her partner, for the duration of treatment and for 1 month following study completion.
For subjects eligible for enrollment to bone health cohort only: life expectancy of at least 6 months, based on investigator assessment.

Exclusion Criteria:

Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to the planned start of larotrectinib or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, and without recovery of acute and/or clinically significant toxicities from that therapy.
Prior progression while receiving approved or investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting TRK. Subjects who received less than 28 days of treatment and discontinued because of intolerance or toxicity are eligible.
Symptomatic or unstable brain metastases. (Note: Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible to participate in the study.) Subjects with primary CNS tumors are eligible.
Uncontrolled concurrent malignancy that would limit assessment of efficacy of larotrectinib. Allowed conditions may include, but are not limited to in situ cancers of cervix, breast, or skin, superficial bladder cancer, limited-stage prostate cancer, and basal or squamous cancers of the skin.

Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection CTCAE grade ≥ 2; unstable cardiovascular disease, or other systemic disease that would limit compliance with study procedures. Unstable cardiovascular disease is defined as:

In adults, persistently uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy.
Myocardial infarction within 3 months of screening.
Stroke within 3 months of screening.
Inability to discontinue treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer
Currently recovering from AEs/ ADRs due to previous treatments (excluding alopecia). Inclusion is only advised once the AE/ADR resolves or recovers to baseline or at least to CTCAE grade 1.
Known or suspected hypersensitivity against the active substance or any of the ingredients of the IMP.
Known history of HIV infection. All patients must be screened for HIV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using a blood test for HIV according to local regulations.
HBV or HCV infection. All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus laboratorial panel. Patients positive for HBsAg or HBcAb will be eligible if they are negative for HBVDNA. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV-RNA.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to treat people who have select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

The study will enroll approximately 231 participants, approximately 32 participants in the dose escalation phase 1 and approximately 76 to 199 participants in the 8 cohorts of dose expansion phase 2. Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 and fixed dose of pembrolizumab until recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined:

• Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Pembrolizumab (Fixed Dose)

Once Phase 2 doses are identified, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive TAK-981 in below defined cohorts in the expansion phase 2:

Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort A: Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort B: Cervical Cancer
Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort C: Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC)
Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort D: Cutaneous Melanoma
Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort E: Squamous NSCLC
Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort F: Checkpoint Inhibitors (CPI) Refractory Squamous or Nonsquamous NSCLC

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is 60 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study drug.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a multiphase, multicenter study, which includes a Phase 1a open-label, dose escalation monotherapy study of ST-067 given as an SC injection with or without obinutuzumab [Gazyva®] pre-treatment, by IV infusion, and in combination with pembrolizumab. A Phase 2 monotherapy arm is also planned; the exact design of the Phase 2 study elements with respect to formulation and pre-treatment will be determined after completion of the Phase 1 study portion of the trial.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Phase 1a is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ST067, administered by subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) dosing, in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, as well as to determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of ST067, administered SC with obinutuzumab (Gazyva®) as pretreatment in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors using a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design. There will be evaluations of ST-067 PK and PD effects.

Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ST-067 administered at the RP2D to patients with the following tumor types. A Simon 2 stage design is used to calculate the sample size and early stopping rules will be employed in the event of lack of efficacy in any of the cohorts. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess tumor response every 8-12 weeks.

Melanoma (n=28)
Renal cell carcinoma (n=25)
Triple-negative best cancer (n=25)
Non-small cell lung cancer (n=25)

        <FieldValue>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate changes in immune activity relative to baseline following treatment with Toca 511 and Toca FC in patients with solid tumors (including recurrent high grade glioma [rHGG]) or lymphoma. This is a multicenter, open-label study of Toca 511 and Toca FC. Patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, for whom curative options are not available, will be enrolled into the study, subject to all entry criteria. Tumors must be accessible to biopsy and/or resection. Patients will be qualified based on the presence of specific molecular characteristics, documented by Foundation Medicine (or equivalent) genomic profile report, and specific tumor types.

Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection followed by (1) intratumoral injection following biopsy or (2) injection into the resection cavity wall following planned resection in the case of rHGG or brain metastases. Toca FC will be administered orally in cycles of therapy.

Patients not undergoing resection of brain tumors will undergo 2 biopsies to allow assessment of baseline and follow-up immune activity in the tumor. Changes in immune activity in peripheral blood will be measured in all patients.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer have been historically treated with surgery whenever they are fit for an operation. However, an alternative treatment known as stereotactic radiotherapy now appears to offer an equally effective alternative. Doctors believe both are good treatments and are therefore conducting this study to determine if one may be possibly better than the other.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The standard of care for stage I non-small cell lung cancer has historically been surgical resection in patients who are medically fit to tolerate an operation. Recent data now suggests that stereotactic radiotherapy may be a suitable alternative. This includes the results from a pooled analysis of two incomplete phase III studies that reported a 15% overall survival advantage with stereotactic radiotherapy at 3 years. While these data are promising, the median follow-up period was short, the results underpowered, and the findings were in contradiction to multiple retrospective studies that demonstrate the outcomes with surgery are likely equal or superior. Therefore, the herein trial aims to evaluate these two treatments in a prospective randomized fashion with a goal to compare the overall survival beyond 5 years. It has been designed to enroll patients who have a long life-expectancy, and are fit enough to tolerate an anatomic pulmonary resection with intraoperative lymph node sampling.

This study is designed to open at Veterans Affairs medical centers with expertise in both treatments. The recruitment process includes shared decision making and multi-disciplinary evaluations with lung cancer specialists. Mandatory evaluations before randomization include tissue confirmation of NSCLC, staging with FDG-PET/CT, and biopsies of all hilar and/or mediastinal lymph nodes &gt;10mm that have a SUV &gt;2.5. Pre-randomization elective lymph node sampling is strongly encouraged, but not required. Following treatment, patients will be followed for a minimum of 5 years.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>TAPISTRY is a Phase II, global, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or in rational, specified combinations in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors determined to harbor specific oncogenic genomic alterations or who are tumor mutational burden (TMB)-high as identified by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Participants with solid tumors will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype, will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified, will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever occurs first.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the antitumor activity of enfortumab vedotin as measured by confirmed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1.

This study will also assess other measures of antitumor activity; overall survival (OS); as well as the safety and tolerability of enfortumab vedotin for cohorts 1 to 8 and enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab in cohort 9.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This study will consist of 3 periods: screening/baseline, treatment and follow-up.

Screening/baseline period will take place up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

In the treatment period, starting at cycle 1, participants in cohorts 1 to 8 will receive enfortumab vedotin on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met. participants in cohort 9 will receive enfortumab vedotin on days 1, 8, and pembrolizumab on day 1 of every 21-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met. Disease assessment will be performed at screening/baseline and repeated every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8 and first assessment at week 9 and thereafter every 6 weeks (42 days ± 7 days) for cohort 9 from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until the participant has radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new subsequent anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.

Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8 and for cohort 9 first scan will be performed at 9 week and thereafter every 6 weeks (42 days ± 7 days) until the subject has radiologically confirmed disease progression (for cohort 9 confirmed progressive disease [iCPD] per modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics [iRECIST]), initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.

After 1 year on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every 12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8.

After 18 months on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days) for cohort 9.

Participants in cohorts 1to 8 who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days).

Participants in cohort 9 who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically confirmed disease progression per iRECIST will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and have physical exams, ECOG and disease assessments every 6 weeks (± 7 days) up to 18 months after first dose, then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) until the subject has radiologically confirmed disease progression per iRECIST.

After radiologically-confirmed disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, participants will be contacted every 12 weeks in the long-term follow-up period for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up or study closure, whichever occurs first.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Doxepin Hydrochloride in Treating Esophageal Pain in Patients With Thoracic Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy to the Thorax With or Without Chemotherapy</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of taking doxepin hydrochloride as compared to placebo (inactive drug) in treating esophageal pain in patients with cancer located in the chest area receiving radiation therapy to the thorax with or without chemotherapy. Doxepin hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant drug which was recently shown to be helpful for mouth pain in patients receiving radiation therapy. Doxepin hydrochloride affects the surface of the esophagus, which may be helpful in reducing the pain caused by radiation therapy.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To provide baseline data regarding the effectiveness of doxepin (doxepin hydrochloride) in reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) to the thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours on day 1.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the adverse event profile of doxepin swish and swallow using a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria, and also for domains of unpleasant taste, burning/stinging discomfort, and drowsiness.

II. To evaluate the effectiveness of doxepin in reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients undergoing RT to the thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hours and then at 2 and 4 hours on days 1 and 3 (including the cross-over phase).

III. To compare and provide baseline data regarding alternative analgesic use between the doxepin and placebo arms.

IV. To provide baseline data regarding the patients? preference for continued therapy with doxepin or placebo after initial test dose or after the cross-over phase, as measured by items 9 and 10 in the patient-reported questionnaire at 4 hours after administration of the study medication and the actual participation rate.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess pain reduction and other adverse event profile in the optional continuation phase of doxepin oral rinse therapy. (Only applies to patients who have the optional continuation of doxepin oral rinse after the first two phases)

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

GROUP I: Patients receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds, and slowly swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm II on day 3.

GROUP II: Patients receive placebo oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds, and slowly swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm I on day 3.

In both arms, patients may continue to receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution every 4 hours as needed during radiation therapy.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Phase IB Study to Evaluate the Safety of Selinexor (KPT-330) in Combination With Multiple Standard Chemotherapy or Immunotherapy Agents in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given together with several different standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens in treating patients with malignancies that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Selinexor may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Studying selinexor with different standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens may help doctors learn the side effects and best dose of selinexor that can be given with different types of treatments in one study.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This study is aimed at understanding the impact of gut microbiota on efficacy of cancer therapies, in particular checkpoint inhibitors, and using the resulting information to design microbial immunotherapies. Although animal models are of use to determine the influences of gut and other microbiota on cancer treatment modalities, they are limited due to differences between mouse and human physiology and immunology, as well as the inherent differences in gut microbial populations between the two mammalian organisms. Therefore, samples obtained as donations from human subjects undergoing cancer treatment are of great value for the identification and determination of bacteria and their metabolic processes that are involved in the successful cure and remission of cancer by checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

The objective of this study is to collect 3 samples each of blood, urine, and stool in subjects with cancer. This is a non-interventional, 2 site study in 100 people who are undergoing any type of cancer immunotherapy. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will provide 5 samples each of blood, urine, and stool over a 12-month period.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>A growing body of evidence indicates that the composition of the gut microbiome can influence the efficacy of cancer drugs. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the presence of certain microbes in the gut is correlated with better responsiveness to the new immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. Providing these particular microbes as a co-therapy may be a way to improve the overall success rate of these drugs. However, very little is currently known about the mechanisms involved in these observed positive effects.

In order to systematically identify how the presence or absence of particular microbes modulates responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapy drugs, Persephone Biome is building a biobank comprised of donated samples from a diversity of cancer patients undergoing various anti-cancer treatments. These samples will be analyzed using metabolic models and machine learning approaches to identify microbial species, gene functions, and metabolic pathways that are associated with efficacy and toxicity of treatments. Ultimately, these data will facilitate the development of live biotherapeutics as co-therapies to various cancer drugs.

This is a non-interventional, 2 site study in 100 subjects who are undergoing any type of cancer immunotherapy. It is preferred that enrollment is balanced by sex; however, it is not required. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will provide 5 samples each of blood, urine, and stool over a 12-month period.

During the screening visit, subjects will receive a stool sampling kit and instructions on how and when to collect the stool sample.

Prior to Visit 2, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with the shipping material provided. At Visit 2 subjects will have blood drawn and urine collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to collect the stool sample. Visit 2 must be conducted prior to the start of immunotherapy.

Prior to Visit 3, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with the shipping material provided. At Visit 3 subjects will have blood drawn and urine collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to collect the stool sample.

Prior to Visit 4, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with the shipping material provided. At Visit 4 subjects will have blood drawn and urine collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to collect the stool sample.

Prior to Visit 5, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with the shipping material provided. At Visit 5 subjects will have blood drawn and urine collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to collect the stool sample.

Prior to Visit 6, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with the shipping material provided. At Visit 6 subjects will have blood drawn and urine collected.

All concomitant medications and adverse events will be recorded. In the event of an adverse event, every effort should be made to collect stool, blood, and urine samples (considered an unscheduled visit).

In the event that a subject discontinues from the study prior to the 12-month visit (Visit 6) all efforts should be made to carry out the assessments for that visit. Visit 6 will also serve as the end of study visit.

Each subject is identified by a unique central identification code that is unique to the study site. This code is only used for study purposes. After informed consent, every person will be given a subject number. The subject code consists of a non interventional study (NIS) code followed by an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country code, and the subject number. For the duration of the study and afterwards, only the subject's physician will be able to identify the subject based on the subject identification code.

Patient data to be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) include demographics, medical history, cancer history, tobacco and alcohol history, diet, prior and concomitant medications, adverse events, and results of tumor scans using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (iRECIST) criteria.

The trained investigator site staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRFs from source documents (e.g., medical records and study-specific data capture tools as needed) directly into the study database on a central server. All information in the eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents. Data recorded directly into the eCRFs will be defined before study start and the eCRFs will be considered the source data. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and a Data Manager will review eCRFs entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy. Automatic quality programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and the resulting queries will be notified to the investigational site using an electronic data query process within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond to queries and make any necessary changes to the data. Details of the data correction process will be specified in the Data Management Plan. A validated, electronic database will be employed from the EDC system. An audit trail of all changes to this database, including the date, reason for the data change and who made the change, will be maintained within the same database. The audit trail will be part of the archived data at the end of the study.

The complete data management process (data capture, data entry, data validation, checks on plausibility, query handling, data editing after entry, coding, data base closure, etc.) will be defined in advance within a data management plan.

Automatic queries will be defined according to the data management plan. These queries will be auto-generated in the EDC system for data correction and accuracy. Corrections will be entered directly into the system. This procedure will be repeated until all queries are resolved.

The Sponsor will conduct a site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect the site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and the procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the subjects' source documentation (i.e., medical records).</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>A Study of Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccines</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is 1) to evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing a patient-specific neoantigen cancer vaccine, which involves predicting the patient's neoantigens and generating a vaccine that encodes the predicted neoantigens; and, 2) to identify and select patients who may be eligible for a shared neoantigen cancer vaccine where their tumor contains a specific shared mutation and who have the correct HLA allele capable of presenting the neoantigen derived from the tumor-specific mutation.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Gritstone is developing two neoantigen-based cancer vaccines: the first is a patient-specific cancer vaccine that requires a manufacturing period for each patient and the second is an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine that targets shared neoantigens.

The process of generating a patient-specific neoantigen cancer vaccine involves multiple steps, including collection of patient tumor and blood specimens, performing next-generation sequencing (NGS), predicting the neoantigens to be included in the patient-specific vaccine, and the manufacture and release of the patient-specific vaccine. Gaining experience in managing the manufacturing process will provide important insights and experience regarding this process to be used in operationalizing future clinical trials.

Selecting patients who may be eligible to receive a shared neoantigen vaccine requires first identifying patients whose tumor possesses a neoantigen derived from an oncogenic mutation that is encoded by the vaccine, and then determining whether the patient expresses a matching HLA allele for antigen presentation.

Study participants will not receive any investigational treatment as part of this trial. Patients screened in this study may be able to enroll in a separate investigational treatment study sponsored by Gritstone Oncology, provided that the patient meets the specified eligibility criteria for that treatment study.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Inclusion Criteria:

Age 18 or older
Willing and able to provide informed consent
Metastatic disease detected on imaging and histologically confirmed:

Triple negative breast cancer TNBC (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1%, her-2-neu 0- 1+ by IHC or FISH-negative or as determined by MD discretion)

Note:

Biopsy of metastasis prior to enrollment is per treating physician's discretion per standard of care. It is preferred but not required.
These patients are selected for the study given the similar survival outcomes when given standard of care therapies
Patient has received at least first-line prior treatment with systemic therapy (either cytotoxic or targeted, including maintenance therapies).
Patients who received prior immunotherapy are allowed.
Patients who had any prior radiation therapy near or overlapping with the oligoprogressive sites are allowed to enroll.
Patients with the following medical conditions precluding them from participating in other systemic therapy or drug trials are allowed:
active liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, or cirrhosis
any other significant medical condition not under control, including any acute coronary syndrome within the past 6 months.
a permanent pacemaker
a QTc &gt; 480 ms in the baseline EKG
peripheral neuropathy of grade &gt;/= 2 per NCI CTCAE
history or known autoimmune disease
current chronic systemic steroid therapy or any immunosuppressive therapy

Oligoprogression, defined as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) documented progression in up to 5 individual lesions

Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria as a guide:

At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the lesion, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the last imaging OR
The appearance of one or more new lesions OR
New/malignant FDG uptake in the absence of other indications of progressive disease or an anatomically stable lesion OR
&gt;/= 5mm increase in the diameter sum of the lesion

OR

Using Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) as a guide:

&gt;30% increase in 18F-FDG SUV peak, with &gt;0.8 SUV units increase in tumor SUV from the baseline scan in pattern typical of tumor and not of infection/treatment effect OR
Visible increase in the extent of 18F-FDG tumor uptake OR

Maximum 5 progressing metastases in any single extra-cranial organ system (i.e. lung, liver, bone)

a. If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more suitable for the metastatic disease, such as surgical resection and interventional radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local therapy with discussion with the PI

No restriction on the total number of metastases
Note: If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more suitable for the metastatic disease, such as surgical resection and interventional radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local therapy with discussion with the PI.
For patients with brain metastases and oligoprogression elsewhere where stereotactic radiation to the brain is warranted, the brain lesions can be treated prior to randomization. This will not be counted toward the 5 progressive lesions.

Any symptomatic metastatic sites requiring prompt palliative radiation (e.g. cord compression) can also be treated with standard of care radiation prior to randomization. This will not be counted toward the 5 progressive lesions.

If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more suitable for the metastatic disease, such as surgical resection and interventional radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local therapy with discussion with the PI.

Exclusion Criteria:

Pregnancy.
Leptomeningeal disease.

        <FieldValue>Aim of the study: The main aim is to collect data of patients with lung cancer, and to perform different analyses on this data. The data contains information on patient and tumor characteristics, imaging, and treatment characteristics. With this data it is possible to improve and validate the predictive model for survival and long term toxicity in lung cancer by multicentric prospective data collection. The long term aim, beyond this specific study, is to build a Decision Support System based on the predictive models validated in this study.

Hypothesis: The general hypothesis is that we get a better prediction in terms of AUC (area under the curve) of survival and long term toxicity when we combine multifactorial variables.

        <FieldValue>Treatment of lung cancer

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in The Netherlands, with an annual incidence exceeding 8,000. Two main variants of lung cancer can be identified: small cell and non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC and NSCLC respectively), the latter comprising approximately 80% of the lung cancer cases. Despite treatment improvement, the prognosis of NSCLC remains poor, with a median survival of 8 months after diagnosis, and a 5 year survival of less than 13%.

Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of NSCLC. Over the years, radiotherapeutical treatment options have increased tremendously. These include dose escalation, more intensive schedules and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. These schedules have improved both local control and survival in patients. However, they also induce more toxicity, and the radiation oncologist faces the challenging task of choosing the optimal therapy for each patient: taking into account tumor characteristics as well as the patient's condition. In other words: the physician must estimate the expected therapeutic ratio often on a background of insufficient outcomes information.

The same problem arises in other therapies for lung cancer, chemotherapy and surgery. In early disease, surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of lung cancer patients. This can be combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Prediction of response

A major problem in lung cancer management is the lack of data dealing with predictive factors for prognosis and treatment outcome. The currently used staging system (TNM) does not accurately predict outcome within homogeneous treatment groups. As a result, an individualized therapeutic ratio cannot be calculated, leading to either over- or under-treatment of many patients and hampering further optimization of any therapy.

Attempts were undertaken to refine and improve the risk stratification, leading to the development of several prediction models. The performance of the models is usually expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The maximum value of the AUC is 1.0; indicating a perfect prediction model. A value of 0.5 indicates that patients are correctly classified in 50% of the cases, e.g. as good as chance.

While high prediction accuracy (AUC=0.85) has been achieved for a population of NSCLC patients of all stages, treated with different modalities, it is a more challenging task to predict survival accurately when focusing on a subgroup. A pretreatment prediction model for patients treated with surgery yielded an AUC of 0.61 while a pretreatment model for patients treated with radiotherapy resulted in an AUC of 0.75. Further improvement of the radiotherapy model was obtained by adding information about blood biomarkers and this extended model yielded an AUC of 0.83. Investigating other blood biomarkers or possible combinations of biomarkers is a challenge and our results underline the importance of using these data in addition to clinical and imaging parameters.

Survival remains certainly an outcome of major importance, but the last decades other treatment-related outcome measures, such as radiation induced lung injury or esophageal damage, became more important for the evaluation of treatment results.

Pneumonitis or radiation induced lung injury has been subject of many studies. However, results are quite difficult to interpret, because many different variables, dosimetric parameters as well as other treatment or patient related characteristics, have been identified, studies showed inconsistent or even conflicting results, and sample sizes were often very limited.

Recently, Chen et al. published a neural network model for prediction of grade 2 or higher pneumonitis, which yielded an AUC of 0.74 in the test dataset31. Compared to other models, these results are promising, although external validation of the model is warranted before it can be used in clinical practice. Our group developed a model predicting dyspnea ≥ grade 2 according to CTCv3.0. Patient as well as dosimetric parameters were incorporated in the model, which resulted in a cross-validated AUC of 0.62.

In summary, existing models perform rather well, but there is a lot of room for improvement by adding new factors as well as applying advanced model building techniques. Prediction models still have to be developed for a number of clinically relevant outcomes. Finally, incorporating confidence intervals in the prediction as well as quantifying the gain in prediction precision if a certain diagnostic/ prognostic test is performed, would certainly be of great value for clinical use of the models (http://www.predictcancer.org/).

Strategies to improve prediction models for lung cancer

In order to improve the prediction models for survival as well as toxicity outcome one can include many variables as possible predictors including imaging, genomics and proteomics information.

3.1 Imaging

An important feature for prognosis on the FDG-PET-scan is the maximal Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax). There is a statistically significant difference in 2-year survival between patients with a high pretreatment SUV and a low pretreatment SUV. Patients with a low SUVmax had a 2-year survival of 90.6%, while patients with a high SUVmax had a 2-year survival of only 58.6%. There is a significant correlation between high SUVmax and a high HIF1α staining in the biopsies, which is a marker for hypoxia. Non significant relations were shown for CA IX, Ki67 and Glut-1 and SUVmax.

Besides FDG, new PET-tracers are being developed. One of the new tracers is HX4, which is a hypoxia tracer. Regulation of tissue oxygen homeostasis is critical for cell function, proliferation and survival. Evidence for this continues to accumulate along with our understanding of the complex oxygen-sensing pathways present within cells. The microenvironment of tumors in particular is very oxygen heterogeneous, with hypoxic areas, which may explain much of our difficulty in treating cancer effectively. This is true when comparing levels of hypoxia among different patient tumors, but also within individual tumors. Accumulating evidence implicates the biological responses to hypoxia and the alterations in these pathways in cancer as important contributors to overall malignancy and treatment efficacy. This has recently prompted several investigations into the possibility of imaging and targeting treatment at the biological responses to hypoxia.

3.2 Gene signatures

Analysis of gene signatures can help to improve the predictive value of the model. An example of this, is the proliferation signature investigated by Starmans et al. Two different signatures of 110 genes were compared in prognostic value. Both showed a very good prognostic value on breast cancer data sets. The AUC (area under the curve) improved when the proliferation signature were added to the models of clinical factors. Another gene profile was tested on early stage NSCLC. This profile consists of 72 genes and is validated on stage I and II NSCLC patients of five centers. It was possible to identify early-stage NSCLC patients with high and low risk for disease recurrence and death within 3 years after primary surgical treatment.

3.3 Tumor biopsies

Hypoxia is (besides in serum) also measurable in the tissue itself. Several markers of hypoxia are predictive for survival. An example is HIF1α, which is upregulated is case of hypoxia. A higher staining of HIF1α is correlated with a worse prognosis in NSCLC. CA IX correlated with severe and chronic hypoxia, and has a strong association with a poor outcome in NSCLC.

Another marker is Ki67, which is expressed in proliferating cells. A higher Ki67 indicates more proliferation, and in a systemic review of Martin et. al. a worse prognosis was shown when Ki67 expression is increased.

3.4 Application of machine learning techniques

The availability of genomic data, together with improved imaging modalities, leads to unprecedented amounts of biological and medical data, which can only be dealt with using computational methods, not only for storing the data, but also for integrating, analyzing, displaying and eventually understanding it.

Machine learning offers a number of techniques for these purposes. These techniques can overcome problems encountered with conventional statistical methods especially if data is highly correlated, many variables are available but a limited number of patients (high-dimensional data), or many different models have to be tested for their predictive value. In the field of radiotherapy and especially for the prediction of treatment responses, machine learning is an upcoming modality. Successes over traditional statistics have already been published 43and first promising results for building predictive models concerning survival of non-small-cell lung-cancer are already found in the literature.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: A stop-smoking plan that includes health education counseling and bupropion may help African-American smokers stop smoking. It is not yet known whether health education counseling is more effective with or without bupropion in helping African Americans stop smoking.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying health education counseling and bupropion to see how well they work compared with a placebo and health education counseling in helping African Americans smokers stop smoking.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To evaluate the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride and health education counseling vs placebo and health education counseling for smoking cessation among African Americans who are light smokers.

Secondary

To characterize CYP2A6 activity in African Americans who are light smokers by evaluating phenotype (3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio [3HC/COT]) and CYP2A6 genotype.
To evaluate the relationship between CYP2A6 activity and smoking cessation outcomes.
To evaluate CYP2A6 genetic polymorphisms associated with nicotine and cotinine metabolism in African Americans who are light smokers.
To measure baseline cotinine and metabolite levels to evaluate the nicotine metabolism phenotype of 3HC/COT.
To evaluate the relationship between nicotine metabolism phenotype of 3HC/COT and smoking cessation outcomes.
To evaluate CYP2A6 genotype as a predictor of smoking cessation outcomes.

Tertiary

To characterize CYP2B6 activity in African Americans who are light smokers by evaluating phenotype and CYP2B6 genotype.
To evaluate the relationship between CYP2B6 activity and smoking cessation outcomes.
To measure steady state bupropion hydrochloride and metabolite levels to identify a bupropion metabolism phenotype.
To evaluate the relationship between bupropion hydrochloride metabolism phenotype and smoking cessation outcomes.
To evaluate the relationship between CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms (genotype) and blood levels of bupropion hydrochloride and active metabolites (phenotype).
To determine the effects of CYP2B6 genotype as predictors of smoking cessation outcomes.

OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to one of two arms.

Arm I: Participants receive oral bupropion hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 0-6. Participants also undergo 6 sessions of health education counseling conducted in person during clinic visits in weeks 0, 3, and 7 and via telephone in weeks 1, 5, and 16. The health education counseling sessions include providing information about the risks of continued smoking and the benefits of quitting, developing a quit plan, outlining a concrete quit day preparation plan, discussing strategies for successful quitting, building social support, reducing stress, recognizing and managing withdrawal and craving, overcoming barriers to abstinence, and using medication for smoking cessation. Participants receive Kick It at Swope: Stop Smoking Guide, a culturally-sensitive smoking cessation guide, to review with their study counselor during the first counseling session.
Arm II: Participants receive an oral placebo once or twice daily in weeks 0-6. Participants also undergo health education counseling as in arm I.

Participants complete baseline questionnaires about demographics, smoking history, and psychometrics, including the following: racial identity, depressive symptoms, alcohol use, stress, smoking consequences, social support, environmental influences of smoking, adherence to study medication, nicotine withdrawal, craving, and mood.

Participants undergo serum sample collection in weeks 0 and 3. To standardize the time since the last cigarette, participants are asked to smoke one cigarette prior to serum sample collection in week 0. Samples are analyzed for nicotine metabolism phenotype and bupropion hydrochloride metabolism phenotype by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 genotype by polymerase chain reaction and polymorphism analysis. Participants who self-report abstinence also undergo saliva sample collection in weeks 7 and 26 to measure cotinine levels to verify smoking status.

After completion of study intervention, participants are followed at 6 months.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of oral BAY 1143269 given alone or in combination with intravenous (IV) docetaxel in subjects with advanced solid tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>BAY 1143269 is a potent and selective, orally administered novel inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MKNK1). MKNK1 activity is essential for the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which promotes the synthesis of oncogenic proteins, inhibits apoptosis, and helps tumor cells survive under stress. Increased p-EIF4E levels were found in tumor tissues from cancer patients. MKNK also functions as a mediator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Established anti-mitotic drugs such as vinca alkaloids, taxanes, or epothilones activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a key surveillance mechanism that monitors the attachment of spindle microtubules to the kinetochores of the chromosomes during pro-metaphase and halts the transitions to anaphase until all chromosomes are bi-oriented, fully attached, and correctly tensed at the metaphase plate. These antimitotic drugs destabilize or stabilize the spindle microtubules and cause mitotic arrest. Prolonged arrest in mitosis forces a cell either into a mitotic exit without cytokinesis or into a mitotic catastrophe leading to cell death. MKNK1 inhibitors allow cell apoptosis and increase tumor death. The combination of taxane and MKNK1 inhibitor can ultimately delay tumor progression and may provide a useful anticancer therapeutic approach.

This study will attempt to answer the following questions:

What is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY 1143269 when given alone or in combination with docetaxel?
What is the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of BAY1143269 when given at the MTD?
What are the adverse events of BAY 1161909 when given at different dose levels with docetaxel?</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), multicenter (more than 1 hospital work on a study), Phase 1 study. The study consists of 4 parts. Part 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety. In part 1, safe and biologically active Phase 2 doses (recommended Phase 2 doses [RP2D]) for JNJ-42756493 will be primarily assessed. Participants will be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting dose and subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493). Part 2 is the Dose Confirmation Phase, which consists of a pre and post treatment tumor biopsy cohorts to confirm the RP2D based on the pharmacodynamic effect of JNJ-42756493 on fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway in tumor. Part 3 is the first Dose Expansion Phase, which is designed to evaluate inclusion biomarkers and preliminary clinical activity at the first RP2D. It consists of 4 expansion cohorts, 1 each for squamous cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, other solid tumors (Cohorts A, B, C, and D). Part 4 is the second Dose Expansion Phase, which is designed to evaluate inclusion biomarkers and preliminary clinical activity at the second RP2D. Biomarker eligibility has also been refined based on emerging data. It consists of 2 expansion cohorts, Cohort E for non-small cell lung cancer and Cohort F for select solid tumors including breast, urothelial, GBM, ovarian, head &amp; neck, esophageal, gastric, and cholangiocarcinoma (Cohorts E and F). Enrollment of some cohorts may be discontinued due to lack of enrollment or for futility. The study is estimated to take approximately 48 months to complete.

        <FieldValue>Irinotecan and Carboplatin as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: The general results of combining irinotecan and platin-based chemotherapies have been very encouraging. As the toxicity profile associated with carboplatin is preferable over cisplatin it is our expectation that patients and physicians would prefer to use this combination if it is equally or more efficacious. To date there has been no agreement regarding the optimal combination of these agents. Based on the trials described in the protocol and our experience with carboplatin/irinotecan in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the present trial will utilize a 21-day cycle of irinotecan 50 mg/m2 given on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC 5 (based on the Calvert formula) on day 1.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with carboplatin works as first-line therapy in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To examine the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of Irinotecan (CPT-11) and Carboplatin as first-line therapy as assessed by response rate in patients with chemo-naïve extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

Secondary

Determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.
Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence), with an Extension Stage II - Pharmacokinetics (Food Effect) with an Extension

This study will enroll approximately 60 subjects in stage I and 60 subjects in stage II with hematologic or solid tumor malignancies, excluding gastrointestinal tumors and tumors that have originated or metastasized to the liver for which no standard treatment exists or have progressed or recurred following prior therapy. Subjects must not be eligible for therapy of higher curative potential where an alternative treatment has been shown to prolong survival in an analogous population. Approximately 23 sites in the US and 2 in Canada will participate in this study.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence)

Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two pharmacokinetic (PK) study days based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

Dosing Sequence 1: 2x150 mg tablets followed by 1x30 mg tablet. Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg tablet followed by 2x150 mg tablets. Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48 hours apart between PK dosing day 1 and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days under fasted conditions.

Stage II - Pharmacokinetics (Food Effect)

Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two PK study days based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

Dosing Sequence 1: 1x300 mg tablet under fasted condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under fed condition.

Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg tablet under fed condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under fasted condition.

Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48 hours apart between PK dosing day 1 and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days. The sponsor will generate the randomization scheme and assign subjects upon enrollment to the appropriate sequence for dosing:

Fasted condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will ingest oral Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast for a minimum of 4 hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after oral Azacitidine administration.

Fed condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and following the performance of all required pre-dose assessments, subjects randomized to receive test medication in a fed state will begin ingesting a breakfast meal 30 (±5) minutes prior to the planned administration of oral Azacitidine. They will continue the entire meal within 20 to 25 minutes (no less than 20 minutes) from the time the meal is served.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The study drug, MDNA11, long-acting &quot;beta-only&quot; recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). MDNA11 specifically engineered to overcome the shortcomings of rhIL-2 (aldesleukin) by preferentially activating immune effector cells (CD8+ T- and NK cells) responsible for killing cancer cells, with minimal or no stimulation of immunosuppressive Tregs. It is designed to potentially enhance host immune response and fusion to albumin increases the half-life further avoiding frequent dosing required with rhIL-2.

The study will be conducted at up to 30 clinical sites following regulatory authority and institutional review board / independent ethics committee (IRB/ IEC) approval and completion of informed consent. The study will be conducted in multiple parts:

Monotherapy (MDNA11 alone) dose escalation
Monotherapy (MDNA11 alone) dose expansion in select tumor types
Combination (MDNA11 + pembrolizumab) dose expansion in select tumor types

Approximately 115 patients will be enrolled.

After commencing treatment (first exposure of MDNA11 alone or MDNA11 + pembrolizumab), tumor assessment by CT/MRI will be performed at 12 weeks ± 1 week for the first scan and thereafter every 8 weeks ± 1 week until immune confirmed progressive disease (&quot;iCPD&quot;) by iRECIST, discontinuation of study drug(s), withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up. Treatment beyond progression may be permitted if criteria are met. Patients can withdraw from participation at any time.</FieldValue>

Following enrollment of these 12 subjects, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will decide if another 6 subjects should be enrolled or if the dose can be determined for Phase 1B and Phase 2 portions of the study to be opened. If another 6 subjects are enrolled to Phase 1A, the IDMC will meet again to decide upon the dose for Phase 1B and Phase 2 prior to opening these portions of the study.

In Phase 1B, three dose expansion cohorts (up to 17 subjects in each cohort for a total of up to 51 subjects) will be added to evaluate for preliminary evidence of biomarker response, including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) and/or serum tumor biomarker (such as CA19-9 and CEA) reduction and clearance in KRAS and NRAS mutated solid tumors (including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [PDAC], colorectal cancer [CRC], and non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]).

In Phase 2, an additional 93 PDAC subjects will be randomized 2:1 (ELI-002 7P versus observation) to further evaluate antitumor activity. Subjects randomized to ELI-002 7P will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of ELI-002 7P during Immunization and Booster Periods. Subjects randomized to observation will have the same safety and efficacy evaluations and will follow the same assessment schedule as subjects randomized to ELI-002 7P but will not receive study treatment. Subjects randomized to observation will be able to elect to cross-over to ELI-002 7P treatment in the event of confirmed disease progression.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of program length on inhaler use compliance, latency to smoking relapse, and gradual cessation of inhaler use in participants using a computer-assisted program to schedule nicotine inhaler dosing for smoking cessation. II. Compare fast and slow paced versions of computer-assisted scheduling of nicotine inhaler use versus ad libitum nicotine inhaler use, in terms of smoking cessation rates, in these participants. III. Compare these dosing conditions, in terms of adherence, initial dosing levels, and successful tapering effects, in these participants.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are randomized to one of three arms. All participants monitor their period of cigarette smoking for 7 days by pressing a data input button on a hand-held computer every time they smoke. Arm I: Participants begin using a nicotine inhaler according to the dosing instructions that come with it and monitor their inhaler usage with the hand-held computer. Arm II: Participants are prompted by the hand-held computer to use a nicotine inhaler based on their prior smoking habits. When prompted, participants use the nicotine inhaler at a comfortable rate over 20 minutes. The computer prompts participants at a fixed frequency and duration of inhaler use for 3 weeks and then tapers the frequency and duration over 3-5 weeks. Arm III: Participants are prompted by the hand-held computer and use a nicotine inhaler as in arm II. The computer prompts participants at a fixed frequency and duration of inhaler use for 12 weeks and then tapers the frequency and duration over 3-5 weeks. Participants keep a weekly diary of the average number of cigarettes smoked, average number of inhaler sessions, and average length of each session. Participants also record the date of any 24-hour smoking cessation and relapse and complete a withdrawal symptoms questionnaire. Participants are followed at 1 year.

        <FieldValue>Study of Neoadjuvant Olaparib Monotherapy and Olaparib and Durvalumab Combination in HER2 Negative BRCAm Breast Cancer</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This study to learn more about olaparib and olaparib plus durvalumab combination therapy and also to better understand the studied disease, breast cancer, and associated health problems.

Olaparib is a type of drug called a PARP (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor. PARP inhibitors can destroy cancer cells that are not good at repairing DNA damage. Olaparib is also approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in other countries for treating women with BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer.

Durvalumab is a type of anticancer drug called immunotherapy that targets cancer cells by blocking the signal that prevents the immune system from seeing the cancer cell. Your immune system can then attack and kill the cancer cells. Durvalumab is approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after receiving chemoradiation therapy and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.

Some parts of this study are experimental, which means that durvalumab and the combination of olaparib and durvalumab are still in the development stage for the treatment of breast cancer, and they are not approved for treatment of breast cancer, except for use in research studies like this.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The investigation of olaparib as monotherapy or olaparib in combination with durvalumab in patients with early stage BRCAm, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative or ER-low, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy supports the ongoing effort to identify novel agents and new drug combinations that can improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival (EFS). In patients at a lower risk (T1b-c/N0) of disease recurrence and a higher chance for cure, monotherapy olaparib may provide adequate neoadjuvant treatment. In contrast, monotherapy olaparib may be inadequate neoadjuvant treatment for those patients at a higher risk (T2/N0 or T1/N1) of recurrence, and the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to the neoadjuvant regimen may improve long-term outcomes as was seen in KEYNOTE-522 and GeparNuevo. However, the risk of irreversible immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) of the endocrine system due to ICI use supports the use of ICIs only in the cohort of patients at higher risk for disease recurrence. For both the lower and higher risk groups, the study treatments have the potential for the development of de-escalation strategies in this disease setting where traditional chemotherapy regimens may be avoided altogether.

While assessment of the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and durvalumab is ongoing, there are sufficient safety data available to develop a safety and tolerability profile for the combination.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing malignancies.

Secondary

Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
Determine the response in patients treated with this drug.
Correlate the induction of antibody against this drug with its pharmacokinetics in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

Patients receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1 followed by SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of ADXS-NEO administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will be performed in 2 phases, a safety phase (Part A and Part B) and an efficacy phase (Part C).</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Mutation-derived tumor antigens, which are often unique to each participant's tumor, represent a new source of targets for cancer immunotherapy. These mutations, which arise during tumorigenesis, are expressed only by the tumor and, as such, may be recognized as newly formed antigens, or neoantigens, by the participant's T cells. The lack of expression of participant-specific tumor mutations in nonmalignant cells suggests that vaccines targeting these tumor mutations have a low risk of autoimmunity and may represent a safer therapeutic approach than many of those currently available. The development of a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based vaccine that expresses these participant-specific tumor antigens and that activates tumor-killing T cells has the potential to be a highly effective form of immunotherapy. In addition, the Lm platform, because it mediates tumor control through multiple mechanisms, may exhibit more robust anti-tumor activity than other vaccine platforms. Thus, the targeting of participant-specific mutation-derived tumor antigens and the concurrent stimulation of host immunity provides a rational approach for boosting anti-tumor immunity, as monotherapy and in combination with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>Inclusion:

Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
Screening tumor biopsy must be adequate for the identification of nonsynonymous somatic mutations (NSMs) by whole exome sequencing and for the development of ADXS-NEO. Biopsies may be repeated for participants whose Screening biopsies are found to be inadequate for the development of ADXS-NEO. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is generally inadequate.

Participant population for Part A (ADXS-NEO monotherapy) is as follows:

Histological or cytological diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) excluding known microsatellite instability (MSI)-high sub-types, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have progressed or have become intolerant to standard therapy, and whose disease may allow management with other available therapies (or a treatment break, if appropriate) for up to approximately 12 weeks following Screening tumor biopsy. More than one form of anti-tumor therapy is allowed during this interval.
For metastatic CRC, up to 4 lines of approved therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibody and targeted agent therapy. Participants may be eligible if they have received additional lines of therapy upon discussion with and approval by the Sponsor. Participants are excluded if they are known to have MSI-high tumors. If the status of microsatellite stability is not known, participants are eligible. The determination of microsatellite stability for CRC may be made by local testing on any available tissue prior to study entry.
For metastatic SCCHN, up to 2 lines of approved therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibody therapy and immunotherapy if eligible. Participants may be eligible if they have received additional lines of therapy upon discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.
For metastatic NSCLC, up to 3 lines of approved therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibodies, targeted agents and immunotherapy if eligible. Tumors harboring squamous and/or non-squamous histologies are eligible. Tumors harboring squamous and/or non-squamous histologies with neuroendocrine or small cell components may be eligible upon discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the effect of ZD6474 on the amount of time between placement of an indwelling pleural catheter and the catheter's removal in patients with malignant pleural effusion.

This study will also look at the effect that ZD6474 has on tumor cells, biological characteristics of cells in the body, rate of fluid build-up around the lungs, tumor size, and thickness of blood vessels. The effect that this drug has on quality of life and shortness of breath will also be examined.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>ZD6474 is an investigational drug that has not yet received approval from the FDA. ZD6474 is designed to limit VEGF. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered to play a key role in the development of pleural effusion. Pleural effusion is an abnormal collection of pleural fluid in the pleural lining surrounding the lungs. The pleural lining is the thin covering that protects and cushions the lungs. It is made up of two layers of tissue that are separated by a small amount of fluid.

ZD6474 has shown promising activity against a number of cancers in laboratory tests in animals with cancer and in some early clinical trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ZD6474 has also demonstrated significant reduction in pleural effusion in association with VEGF inhibition of tumor cells in mice with lung tumors and pleural effusion. It is hoped that ZD6474 will decrease the amount of pleural effusion that occurs in NSCLC patients. In addition, ZD6474 is thought to block the formation of new blood vessels, which may limit new blood vessel growth in the tumor and &quot;starve&quot; the tumor.

Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and weight. You will be asked questions about your ability to perform daily activities (performance status evaluation). You will have blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests. You may have up to 3 electrocardiograms (ECG --a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will also have a chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of your chest to measure the status of the disease. You will be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires about the quality of your life and shortness of breath. The questionnaires will take about 10-15 minutes, total, to complete. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.

If you are found to be eligible to participate in the study, you will have an indwelling intrapleural catheter placed. You will have to sign a separate consent document before placement of an indwelling intrapleural catheter can be performed. The pleural fluid will be collected at each clinic visit. The fluid will be saved and analyzed to answer research questions that are part of this study. You will also need to drain your pleural fluid everyday. The research nurse will provide you with instructions on how to drain your daily pleural fluid and a patient &quot;diary&quot; to take home to record the amount of fluid drained every day. The study doctor or research nurse will review the diary at each clinic visit.

After placement of the intrapleural catheter (Day 1), you will receive treatment with ZD6474. Treatment on this study is for 10 weeks. You will take a ZD6474 tablet by mouth each morning. The tablet should not be chewed, crushed, or divided, and should be taken with 8 ounces of water. You should take the tablet at about the same time every day.

During your participation on this study, you will have a physical exam, routine blood tests and chest x-ray at Weeks 2, 6, and 10. At Weeks 6 and 10, you will also have a CT scan. You will have an ECG at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. Your doctor may decide to have additional ECGs to monitor your condition or if you experience a heart rate of less than 50 at any time during study participation. You will also be asked to complete 2 questionnaires about the quality of your life and any shortness of breath you are experiencing. You will complete these questionnaires at home and return them to the research staff at each clinic visit. You will be asked to record your weekly blood pressure for the first 6 weeks of study treatment. The study doctor or research nurse will review the log at each clinic visit.

If you are benefitting from the study treatment and your doctor feels that it is your best interest, you may continue to receive the study drug longer than 10 weeks. During your participation in this extended treatment phase, every 4 weeks you will have a physical exam and your performance status will be evaluated. You will have blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests. Every 4 weeks, you will have ECGs performed. You will also have a chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of your chest to measure the status of the disease every 8 weeks. Your study drug will continue to be provided to you.

You may be taken off study early if you have intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.

This is an investigational study. ZD6474, the investigational drug to be used in this study, is not approved by the FDA for commercial use; however, the FDA has permitted its use in this research study. Up to 25 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Exercise may help improve mobility and relieve fatigue and/or weakness in cancer survivors. It is not yet known whether exercise is more effective than standard therapy in improving mobility and reducing fatigue and/or weakness in older cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying exercise to see how well it works compared to standard therapy in improving mobility and reducing fatigue and/or weakness in older cancer survivors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Compare the perception of, and the patterns of change in fatigue, weakness, physical activity level, and functional status in elderly cancer survivors who undergo Resistance Exercise via Negative-Eccentric Work (RENEW) vs standard care.
Compare changes in muscle structure, function (strength + power production and metabolic function) and mobility.
Evaluate the patient's adherence to and satisfaction with the RENEW intervention.

OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, longitudinal study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

Arm I: Patients undergo resistance exercise via negative-eccentric work (RENEW), using a special seated stationary leg exercise machine, 3 times a week for up to 12 weeks. Exercise exertion and duration is gradually increased weekly for the first 4-5 weeks of RENEW.
Arm II: Patients receive standard care. In both arms, fatigue, weakness, physical activity, functional status, muscle structure and function, and mobility are assessed at baseline and then at 12 weeks after completion of study intervention. Fatigue and weakness are also assessed weekly during study intervention. Patients in arm I also undergo isometric strength assessment weekly during RENEW and assessment of adherence to and satisfaction with RENEW at 12 weeks after completion of RENEW.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The goal of the first part of this clinical research study is to learn how to deliver more accurate radiation treatment of tumors in the spine. Researchers also want to learn how internal organs might move during radiation treatment.

The goal of the second part of this study is to learn if it is safe to allow slightly more radiation to the normal esophagus when spinal tumors close by are being treated. This may result in better tumor control.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of 10 participants will be enrolled in the first part of the study, and up to 2 groups of 10 participants will be enrolled in the second part of the study. Only participants who will receive a single spinal SBRT treatment are eligible for the second part of the study.

The participants in the first part of the study will receive standard doses of radiation therapy to normal organs while treating the tumor. In the second part of the study, each new group will receive a higher dose of radiation to the esophagus than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

Radiation Planning and Treatment:

Before starting radiation treatment, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about any symptoms you might be having and any drugs that you are taking. It should take about 10 minutes to complete. After treatment, you will be given copies of the questionnaire to take with you, and asked to fill it out 1 time a week for the next 4 weeks. You should return the questionnaires by mail. Self-addressed stamped envelopes will be given to you.

During all radiation treatments, the images that are taken during your treatment will be closely analyzed after treatment is over. You will have 1 to 3 radiation treatment sessions depending on your doctor's decision.

If you are in the second part of the study, you will receive slightly more radiation than usual to the normal esophagus.

The rest of your radiation treatment planning and treatment delivery appointments will be unchanged. The dose given to the tumor and number of treatments you receive will be determined by your doctor, and is not affected by taking part in this study.

Follow-Up Visits:

After your radiation treatment schedule ends, you will return for follow-up visits at the following time points:

At 3 months
Then, every 3 months for 1 year
Every 6 months during year 2, and then
1 time a year after that, for as long as possible

Additional follow up visits may be scheduled, if your doctor thinks they are needed.

At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

Any updates to your medical history will be recorded and you will be asked about any side effects you may be having.
Your performance status will be recorded.
Your completed symptom questionnaires will be reviewed.
You will have a physical, including measurement of your vital signs
You will have a neurological exam.
You will have follow-up imaging (such as an MRI) to check the status of the disease.

This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. It is considered investigational to give increased radiation to the esophagus.

        <FieldValue>Study of 18F-Fluoro-PEG6-IPQA</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an imaging solution called 18F-PEG6-IPQA can help to find tumors when used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The safety of the solution and how the solution is processed by your body will also be studied.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>18F-PEG6-IPQA is a solution that is designed to be attracted to tumor cells. The imaging solution has a small dose of radiation added to it, which may help doctors see the cancer cells better during imaging scans. This is the first study using 18F-PEG6-IPQA in humans.

Study Imaging:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will visit the clinic on Day 1 for the injection of the study solution and PET scans. This imaging study will be performed at FDA-cleared PET-CT scanners at MD Anderson sites, including at the Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI).

For up to 6 hours before the PET scans and computed tomography (CT) scans, you must not eat or drink anything except water. This is called fasting.

A small tube will be placed in your arm and you will receive an injection of 18F-PEG6-IPQA.

After the injection, scanning will begin immediately. You will have 3 PET scanning sessions with a PET/CT scanner. Before each PET scan, you will have a CT scan to make sure you are in the right position for the PET scans. Each PET scan may last up to 1 hour. Each positioning CT scan should take about 5 minutes. You will have a 10 minute &quot;rest period&quot; between each PET scan.

Study Visits:

On Day 1:

Before the imaging solution is injected, your vital signs and an ECG rhythm strip will be collected. The study staff will insert an intravenous (IV) needle and line into each of your arms.
Right after the injection of the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons total) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing from one of the existing IV lines. PK testing measures the amount of study solution in the body at different time points. Blood will be drawn at 1, 3, 8, 16, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 150 minutes after the injection of 18F-PEG6-IPQA for a total of 9 draws.
About 30 minutes after the injection, your vital signs will be measured and the injection site will be checked.
Urine will be collected during the 10 minute rest periods in between scans or at the completion of the 3-hour scanning period.
After the scans are completed (about 3 hours after the injection) your vital signs and injections site will be checked again, and you will have an ECG rhythm strip taken. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will also be collected for routine tests.

On Days 2 and 7:

Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
Your vital signs and the injection site will be checked
You will be asked about any side effects you may be having since the injection.

End-of-Study Visit:

The end-of-study visit will be about 14 days after the injection of 18F-PEG6-IPQA and imaging scans. The following tests and procedures will be performed:

Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
The injection site will be checked.
You will have an ECG.

Length of Study:

You will be in this study for about 14 days. You will be taken off study early if intolerable side effects occur.

This is an investigational study. 18F-PEG6-IPQA is not FDA-approved or commercially available for use in imaging scans. Its use in this study is investigational.

The scans performed with 18F-PEG6-IPQA are also considered investigational and will not be used for planning any of your future cancer treatment.

Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All participants will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with previously untreated, surgically-resectable, solid tumor brain metastases. The primary objectives of this study are to 1) assess the feasibility of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment before surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with solid tumor brain metastases as measured by the proportion of patients who have their surgery delayed or surgery never occurs, and 2) demonstrate that neoadjuvant immunotherapy will increase proliferation of circulating T-cells compared to baseline measurements. Exploratory objectives include describing patient progression free survival and overall survival, time to local and distant intracranial progression, and the rate of radiation necrosis. The rate of radionecrosis will also be explored, as immune expression profiles.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This trial is an open-label, multi-site, Phase I/IIa dose escalation, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of BNT141 followed by expansion cohorts in patients with CLDN18.2-positive tumors.

The trial design consists of three parts:

Part 1A is a dose escalation of BNT141 as monotherapy in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2)-positive solid tumors for which there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or the patient is not a candidate for such available therapy. The dose of BNT141 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BNT141 as monotherapy are defined. Eligible tumor types are gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and esophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic, biliary tract (cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer), and mucinous ovarian cancers. Additionally, patients with specific tumors (including colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, gastric subtype of endocervical adenocarcinoma) where there is scientific evidence that the CLDN18.2 could be elevated can be tested for CLDN18.2 expression.

Part 1B is a dose escalation of BNT141 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic CLDN18.2-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma who are eligible for treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Part 1B intends to define the MTD and/or RP2D of the combination.

Part 2 with adaptive design elements will be added at a later stage.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to determine if EMD 1201081 in combination with cetuximab is more efficient than cetuximab alone to control the cancer.

EMD 1201081 is an immune modulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) containing phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide and acts as an agonist of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).

EMD 1201081 has been studied in six clinical trials in over 170 subjects either as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies. Two studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers. In the other five studies, subjects with advanced solid tumors, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer have been treated with EMD 1201081. Two studies are still ongoing. Future clinical development of EMD 1201081 will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC) and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN).

In this Phase 2 study, subjects with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN), will be treated with cetuximab plus EMD 1201081 or cetuximab alone. The study will be conducted as a multicenter study in several European Union (EU) member states and the Unites States.

EMD 1201081 in combination with cetuximab will be evaluated for antitumor activity in subjects by examining its effects on accepted clinical endpoints. Progression-free survival (PFS) will be evaluated in subjects treated with EMD 1201081 plus cetuximab compared to cetuximab alone in cetuximab-naïve subjects with R/M SCCHN who have progressed on a cytotoxic therapy.

Cetuximab, approved in colorectal cancer and SCCHN in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and SCCHN in combination with radiotherapy in the EU, will be provided as investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study. Commercially available Cetuximab will be provided in the United States.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This trial will look at a drug called SEA-TGT (also known as SGN-TGT) to find out whether it is safe for patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. It will study SEA-TGT to find out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study whether SEA-TGT works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas.

The study will have four parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SEA-TGT should be given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-TGT is and if it works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas. Part C will study how well SEA-TGT with sasanlimab works to treat solid tumors. Part D will study how well SEA-TGT with brentuximab vedotin works to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Amatuximab for High Mesothelin Cancers</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Background:

- Amatuximab is a cancer treatment drug that targets mesothelin. High levels of this substance are found on some kinds of tumor cells. Lab studies have shown that amatuximab helps the immune system to kill cells that have high levels of mesothelin. However, more research is needed to determine how safe and effective amatuximab is for treating tumors with high levels of mesothelin.

Objectives:

- To assess the safety and effectiveness of amatuximab in treating tumors with high levels of mesothelin.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a type of cancer that overexpresses mesothelin.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood tests and tumor assessment studies.
Participants will have two intravenous doses of amatuximab several hours apart. Researchers will monitor them closely and do frequent blood draws. On the same day and also within 48 hours of the second dose, participants will have imaging studies. These studies will measure how well the amatuximab is working against the cancer.
Participants will have a third imaging study of the cancer about 1 week after the infusions.
Participants will have a followup visit 2 weeks after receiving amatuximab. This visit will require blood samples. Four weeks after receiving the drug, researchers will review patients symptoms or side effects. This interview can be done in person or by phone.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Background:

Amatuximab is a high-affinity monoclonal IgG antibody raised against human mesothelin.
Mesothelin is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-linked membrane glycoprotein thought to be involved in tumor metastasis
Mesothelin is over-expressed in many cancers

Objectives:

-The primary objective is to determine the biodistribution of radiolabeled amatuximab in tumor and nontumor tissues in subjects with mesothelin over-expressing cancers including mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, and non small cell lung cancer.

Eligibility:

Female or male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age;
Histologically confirmed mesothelin-expressing cancer;
Transaminases less than or equal to 3 times ULN for mesothelioma, non small cell lung and ovarian cancer;

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Background:

- Gemcitabine and carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used to treat several types of cancer, including cancer of the pancreas, bladder, ovaries, and lung. Lenalidomide, a drug that prevents the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, has been approved for treatment of certain blood cancers, but it has not yet been approved for use in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin. Researchers are interested in determining the safest and most effective dose of this combined form of chemotherapy for solid tumors, particularly for urothelial cancer (tumors of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis).

Objectives:

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for solid tumor cancers.
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for urothelial (bladder) cancer.

Eligibility:

Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.
Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with urothelial cancer that has not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.
Participants with urothelial cancer will receive lenalidomide alone for the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle before starting the first full treatment cycle.
All participants will receive gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin on day 1 only, of every 21-day treatment cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily at home for the first 14 days of each cycle. Participants will be asked to take aspirin or other medications to prevent the possibility of blood clots.
Participants may receive up to six cycles of treatment with this combination. If after six cycles the cancer has not grown or has shrunk, participants may continue to take lenalidomide alone for an additional 6 months (total of 12 months of therapy) or until the cancer recurs.
Participants will be monitored with blood samples, physical examinations, and tumor imaging studies through the cycles of treatment.
After the end of the last treatment cycle, participants will have followup visits every 3 months for the next 18 months, then every 6 months for another 18 months, and then yearly.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>BACKGROUND:

Gemcitabine plus carboplatin is an accepted first-line therapy in patients unfit for cisplatin chemotherapy with metastatic urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumor malignancies.
Both non-clinical and clinical data support targeting angiogenesis in urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.
Both non-clinical and clinical data support targeting the immune system in urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.
Lenalidomide has both anti-angiogenic and potent immunomodulatory properties.
Lenalidomide has been safely coadministered with cytotoxic therapy in patients with solid tumors and non-clinical studies demonstrate possible synergy with gemcitabine.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

- To establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide which can be safely combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors that are unfit for cisplatin.

Secondary

To preliminarily evaluate the progression free survival, response rate and overall survival in patients with advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors treated with the combination of lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin.
To determine the effects of treatment on a set of 4 laboratory parameters (including Treg, sIL-2R, VEGF and CTC.) in the expansion cohort of patients with bladder cancer treated at the MTD.

ELIGIBILITY:

Adult patients with histologic documentation of an advanced solid tumor with unresectable or metastatic disease.
Urothelial cancer patients should be ineligible for cisplatin based on one or more of the following:
Calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 mL/min (but greater than or equal to 30 mL/min)
Solitary kidney
Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 80%
No prior combination systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease allowed for patients with UC, except single agent radiosensitizing chemotherapy (not considered prior systemic therapy), or prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (including cisplatin-based) is allowed provided if it was completed (Bullet) 6 months prior to diagnosis of metastatic disease; or prior intravesical therapy is permitted. Up to 1 line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is permitted for non UC patients.
Laboratory evaluation must meet safety requirements, including a creatinine clearance greater than 30 using the Cockroft-Gault formula; may not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

DESIGN:

This is a single-institution phase I study of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) plus escalating doses of lenalidomide (GCL) in patients with advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors ineligible for cisplatin therapy. Lenalidomide will be administered once daily on days 1 through 14 every 21 days at escalating dose. An expansion cohort at the MTD of an additional 15 patients with bladder cancer will be enrolled in order to determine whether there are differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment levels of the following parameters: Treg, sIL- 2R, VEGF and CTC.
Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin in combination with lenalidomide unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who achieve stable disease, a partial response, or a complete response after completion of 6 cycles will be eligible to continue lenalidomide alone at the same dose and schedule until disease progression. Restaging evaluations will occur after every 3 cycles of treatment (approximately 9 weeks).
Based on a standard 3+3 design with 4 dose levels per cohort, a maximum of 24 patients, with the potential for an additional 3 patients with CrCl&gt;60 mL/min, may need to be evaluated to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in this combination therapy. With an expansion cohort of 15 patients at MTD, a total of 42 subjects may be enrolled over 1.5 -3 years.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: A study that evaluates participants' beliefs about smokeless tobacco products and nicotine replacement therapy may be useful in helping smokers stop smoking.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the acceptability of less harmful alternatives to cigarettes.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To assess the impact of factual information (a fact sheet) about the relative harms of smokeless (SL)/nicotine replacement (NR) products on participants' beliefs about relative harmfulness.
To assess the impact of trying samples of NR and/or SL products on intentions to use such products as alternatives to cigarettes.

Secondary

To explore the effects of factual information in regard to smoked tobacco on smokers' intentions to use such products as alternatives to cigarettes.
To assess potential barriers to use of both NR and SL products as substitutes for cigarettes.
To obtain estimates of possible effect sizes for powering a proposed comprehensive test of the likely outcomes of using these products in preference to cigarettes (and other smoked products).

OUTLINE:

Participants undergo a 10-15 minute web-based survey on a computer in the Tobacco Research Laboratory to assess basic demographic information; beliefs about the relative harmfulness of nicotine replacement (NR) and smokeless (SL) products, including use of relevant questions from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) 4 country survey; past experiences with NR and SL products and perceptions about them; and willingness to try samples of NR/SL products they have not previously used, or, if not willing, reasons for refusal. Participants also receive an information sheet while simultaneously hearing an audio recording of it.

Participants complete questionnaires at 2, 3, and 4 weeks.

Beginning 2 weeks after study intervention, some participants receive a day's supply of ≤ 4 smokeless tobacco or nicotine products and periodically undergo a breath CO and saliva and buccal cell sample collection. Surveys are completed and samples collected at 3 and 4 weeks.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

To determine if patient-reported quality of life (QOL) can be improved by the real-time use of QOL data in patients with primary lung, head and neck, or gastrointestinal cancer undergoing radiotherapy.
To obtain preliminary estimates for effect sizes on differences in key QOL domains between patients receiving real time QOL data and those not receiving QOL data.
To obtain preliminary estimates of differences in patient satisfaction between patients receiving real time QOL data and those not receiving QOL data.
To determine whether the availability of real-time QOL assessments in a radiation oncology practice increases the acceptance and utilization of QOL data by a clinical oncology team.
To evaluate clinician attitudes towards the incorporation of real-time QOL data into oncology patient management.
To evaluate the use of a set of clinical pathways for the incorporation of real time QOL data into oncology patient management.
To evaluate the potential impact on the quality of the patient-physician relationship with real-time use of QOL data compared to interactions where quality of life data are not utilized.
To obtain preliminary estimates of whether the real-time use of QOL data in a radiation oncology practice significantly increases the duration of the weekly on treatment visit.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

Group 1 (control): Patients complete QOL assessments (e.g., the Linear Analog Self Assessment [LASA]) at weeks 1, 3, and 5 during treatment and the last week of treatment. They also complete the Interpersonal Patient-Provider Relationship Scale (IPPRS) and Was it Worth It (WIW) questionnaires on the final day of treatment.

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Varenicline, the nicotine patch, and nicotine gum help people stop smoking. It is not yet known whether varenicline is more effective than the nicotine patch given together with nicotine gum in helping smokers quit smoking.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying varenicline to see how well it works compared with the nicotine patch given together with nicotine gum in helping smokers in a methadone treatment program stop smoking.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To determine whether varenicline, a nicotine receptor partial agonist, leads to a higher rate of smoking cessation than combination nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine patch prescription plus ad libitum nicotine gum delivery in methadone-maintained smokers.

Secondary

To test the effects of the treatments on smoking urges, withdrawal symptoms, and reinforcing effects of smoking.
To test the effects of the treatments on methadone treatment outcomes, including retention in methadone maintenance, methadone dose changes, and continued use of illicit drugs as measured by urine toxicologies.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified based on gender and level of nicotine dependence. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms.

At baseline, all patients receive a minimal behavioral intervention using a 3-minute, simple smoking cessation counseling strategy, a self-help manual, and a telephone quit-line number.

Arm I (varenicline): Patients receive oral varenicline once daily on days 1-3 and twice daily thereafter for a total of 6 months or when a comfortable level of smoking abstinence is reached.
Arm II (placebo): Patients receive oral varenicline placebo once daily on days 1-3 and twice daily thereafter for a total of 6 months or when a comfortable level of smoking abstinence is reached.
Arm III (nicotine patch/gum): Patients receive a nicotine patch, with doses tapering over time for a total of 26 weeks. Patients also receive nicotine gum to quell breakthrough urges. Patients may stop treatment when a comfortable level of smoking abstinence is reached.

Patients complete a brief interview over 10-15 minutes at 2 weeks and monthly during months 1-5. They complete a longer interview over 45 minutes at months 6 and 12 and provide breath samples (for carbon monoxide monitoring) and urine samples (for cotinine testing).

NOTE: Smoking cessation may prevent certain smoking-related illnesses, including cancer.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 602 patients (258 receiving varenicline, 258 receiving nicotine replacement therapy, and 86 receiving placebo) will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale clinical trial to evaluate whether extending the duration of pre-cessation bupropion hydrochloride enhances smoking cessation, as measured by 3-month prolonged abstinence rates, in adult smokers.

Secondary

Assess baseline smoking and mood characteristics (nicotine dependence, smoking history, anxiety, and depression).
Assess measures to address the hypothesized extinction mechanism (subjective effects of smoking, collection of cigarette butts for an assessment of nicotine and tar exposure, craving for smoking, and expectations for the consequences of smoking).
Assess changes in affective state as measured by Withdrawal Symptoms Checklist and by Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire.
Assess side effects, pill counts, and changes in daily smoking rate.
Assess mental health, personality traits, interpersonal skills, demand simulation, impulsivity, motivation, and perceived stress using validated measures.

OUTLINE: Participants are stratified according to gender. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 pre-cessation intervention arms.

Arm I (1-week run-in): Participants receive an oral placebo once or twice daily in weeks 1-3 followed by oral bupropion hydrochloride once or twice daily in week 4. Participants also undergo 90-minute behavioral group counseling sessions once in weeks 1, 2, and 4.
Arm II (4-week run-in): Participants receive oral bupropion hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 1-4. Participants also undergo 90-minute behavioral group counseling sessions once in weeks 1, 2, and 4.

In both arms, participants are asked to quit smoking (target quit date) in week 5. All participants then receive oral bupropion hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 5-11 and undergo 90-minute behavioral group counseling sessions once in weeks 5, 7, and 9.

Participants complete questionnaires to collect information on tobacco use history, health habits, depression, anxiety scales/symptoms, and sociodemographics at baseline. Participants also complete a series of validated questionnaires about smoking patterns, smoking satisfaction, mental health, personality traits, interpersonal skills, demand simulation, impulsivity, motivation, and perceived stress at baseline and then periodically during study. Participants undergo saliva sample collection at baseline and then periodically during study. Samples are analyzed for the presence of cotinine. Buccal cells are also collected at baseline for subsequent DNA analyses. Cigarette butts from the first cigarette of the day, including the quit day, are collected during group counseling sessions in weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 and are assessed for a marker that indicates the amount of nicotine and tar consumed.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Determine whether zinc supplements reduce cadmium levels in smokers.
Measure serum levels of cotinine (a biomarker of smoking), zinc (a marker of compliance), and cadmium (the dependent variable) at 3 pre-supplementation visits and at 6 supplementation visits.
Determine whether serum cadmium levels (adjusted for serum levels of cotinine) decrease during supplementation with VisiVite Smoker's Formula.
Determine if increased cadmium levels in the blood of cigarette smokers can be correlated with decreased mismatch repair.
Determine if administration of zinc-containing supplements reverses cadmium-induced inhibition of mismatch repair.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

Patients receive oral zinc supplements once daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Blood, serum, and urine are collected once weekly for 3 weeks before beginning treatment and in weeks 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 17 for biomarker/laboratory analysis. Samples are examined for cadmium, zinc, and cotinine levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, expression of mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MSH3, MLH1, and PMS2), levels of messenger RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and microsatellite instability by gel electrophoresis.

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together with cetuximab in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given together with cetuximab in patients with advanced solid tumors expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Secondary

To obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib and cetuximab.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cetuximab IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and gemcitabine in treating older patients with advanced solid tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly bortezomib and gemcitabine in treating elderly patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary

To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of bortezomib and gemcitabine in these patients.
To obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib and gemcitabine.
To characterize gemcitabine and metabolite pharmacokinetics in patients receiving concurrent bortezomib therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of bortezomib and gemcitabine.

Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes followed 1 hour later by bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose of the combination is determined.

Blood is collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to determine whether lucitanib is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic lung cancer and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF), or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) related genetic alterations.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Lucitanib is an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR 1-3, VEGFR 1-3, and PDGFR α/β. Lucitanib has demonstrated potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity in vitro proliferation assays and in vivo using human tumor xenograft models, with a trend for stronger efficacy in those with genomic aberrancies of FGF or PDGF. Abnormalities in the FGF, VEGF, and PDGF-related genes are observed across lung cancer histologies.

The first in human trial of lucitanib demonstrated that daily lucitanib is clinically active in patients with advanced solid tumors. Specifically, patients with FGFR1-amplification appeared to derive particular benefit from lucitanib.

Based on these results, this study is designed to explore the safety and anti-tumor activity of daily lucitanib in lung cancer patients with FGF, VEGF, and PDGF genetic alterations.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a 2-part study to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of MSC-1. MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with advanced solid tumors. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in many physiological and pathological processes including the promotion of an immunosuppressive environment. In cancer, it is hypothesized that LIF expressing malignancies co-opt this activity, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as well as promoting the activity of cancer-initiating cell(s) (CICs). LIF is highly expressed in a subset of tumors across multiple solid tumor types.

During dose escalation, patients with advanced solid tumors will be treated with MSC-1 with the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of MSC-1 and defining an appropriate dose for further evaluation in dose expansion. MSC-1 will be administered intravenously (IV) until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or study termination.

In dose expansion, up to 4 parallel cohorts of patients with LIF-High tumors (NSCLC, Ovarian Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer), and a cohort of mixed solid tumors (referred to as the &quot;basket cohort&quot;), may be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of MSC-1.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The goal of this clinical research trial is to study the use of differing investigational doses and scheduling for Proton Therapy for tumors previously treated with radiation therapy. Generally, when patients are first treated for cancer with radiation therapy, they are treated with traditional photon (or x-ray) radiation therapy, which uses high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. In some cases, the cancer either returns or a new tumor can present in a different part of the body. With the usual radiation treatment, the photon beams travel all the way through the body. As a result, healthy tissues in front of and behind the tumor are exposed to radiation. Physicians who treat these cases where the tumor has returned often use a much lower dose of radiation to prevent patients from experiencing serious and long-term side-effects. This dose is often not strong enough to destroy the cancerous tumor. Alternatively, they may also treat a smaller area than would be indicated for complete tumor eradication, again in an attempt to prevent serious and long-term toxicities, but at the cost of optimally treating the cancer. Proton therapy, however, may offer a chance to safely deliver a more effective dose and volume of radiation as it is more targeted and can spare healthy tissues surrounding the tumor.

The reason we are conducting this research study is to look at whether Proton therapy can be a better way to treat reoccurring tumors in patients who have previously received radiation therapy to the same area, compared to treatment approaches used to date.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of I-131-CLR1404, a radiolabeled therapy compound, for treating subjects with cancer that does not respond to treatment or has returned. The identified recommended dose in this study will be used as the optimal dose of I-131-CLR1404 in subsequent clinical trials conducted for later phase clinical development.

Subjects who meet study entry criteria will receive I-131-CLR1404. For each subject, the study will be conducted in two phases, dosimetric and therapy. In the dosimetric phase, subjects will receive one 5 mCi dose of the study drug and undergo whole body imaging on on the day of infusion and on post-infusion days 1, 2, 3, and 6 for assessment of biodistribution of I-131-CLR1404. If normal and expected biodistribution are demonstrated, the subject will begin the therapy phase. In the therapy phase, the first cohort of subjects will receive a dose of 12.5 mCi/m2. Dose escalation in subsequent cohorts will initially be in increments of 12.5 mCi/m2. Subjects will be followed and observed for unacceptable toxicity through 56 days after the therapy dose infusion with follow-up for up to one year.

All subjects will be prescribed thyroid protection medication to be taken 24 hours prior to injection of the dosimetric dose, and continuing for 14 days after the administration of the therapy dose.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>In an unbiased CRISPR screen, RIPK1 was identified as a top gene contributing to immunotherapy resistance. In addition, RIPK1 has been reported to drive pancreatic oncogenesis. In murine models, inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment leads to the replacement of tumor-permissive myeloid infiltrates with innate cells that promote an effective antitumor response by adaptive cells. The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of RIPK1 in human pancreatic cancer subjects will modulate the immune infiltrate to sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade.</FieldValue>

Therefore, a barrier method is also required for subjects using a hormonal option (including hormonal intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive pills/ patch/ vaginal inserts, and hormonal implants) and both highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment.If a highly effective non-hormonal method is used, then only one method of contraception is required (by a female participant or partner of a male participant; in either situation the male partner must still use a male condom in addition) during the treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum) as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the subject must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive. If the subject hasn't been on an acceptable method of contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to start of therapy, pregnancy testing must be done weekly for the first month of treatment. Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study treatment. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.
Histological documentation of locally advanced, recurrent or PDAC (Part 1), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), or melanoma (Part 2) that has progressed after standard therapy appropriate for the specific tumor type, or for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable, or is considered inappropriate. Subjects should have received at least one, but not more than 2 prior lines of therapy for advanced disease including both standards of care and investigational therapies. Subjects whose cancers harbor molecular alterations for which targeted therapy is standard of care should have received health authority-approved appropriate targeted therapy for their tumor types before enrollment.
All subjects in Parts 1 and 2 must consent to provide a fresh biopsy during screening of a primary tumor lesion or from other metastases (e.g. liver, lung, etc.), and a second biopsy after approximately 5 weeks of treatment.
Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1. Palpable lesions that are not measurable by radiologic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as the only measurable lesion. Subjects are encouraged to provide a pre-Baseline scan (within 24 weeks before the Baseline scan) to support exploratory investigation of tumor growth kinetics.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1.
Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.
Adequate organ function.

        <FieldValue>Safety Study of CALAA-01 to Treat Solid Tumor Cancers</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Rationale: CALAA-01 is a targeted therapeutic designed to inhibit tumor growth and/or reduce tumor size. The active ingredient in CALAA-01 is a small interfering RNA (siRNA). This siRNA inhibits tumor growth via RNA interference to reduce expression of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R2). The CALAA-01 siRNA is protected from nuclease degradation within a stabilized nanoparticle targeted to tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial will:

Determine the safety, toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CALAA-01 when administered intravenously to patients with relapsed or refractory cancer.
Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CALAA-01 after intravenous administration.
Provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of intravenous CALAA-01 by evaluating tumor response.
Recommend a dose of intravenous CALAA-01 for future clinical studies.
Evaluate immune response, by measuring antibody and cytokine levels, and the effect of intravenous CALAA-01 on complement.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>CALAA-01 is a targeted nanocomplex that contains anti-R2 siRNA. The complete nanocomplex formulation consists of four components:

a duplex of synthetic, non-chemically-modified siRNA (C05C)
a cyclodextrin-containing polymer (CAL101),
a stabilizing agent (AD-PEG), and
a targeting agent (AD-PEG-Tf) that contains the human transferrin protein (Tf). The cationic polymer interacts electrostatically with anionic siRNA to assemble into nanocomplexes below approximately 100 nm in diameter that protect the siRNA from nuclease degradation in serum. The siRNA-containing nanocomplexes are targeted to cells that over express the transferrin receptor (TfR). Upon reaching a target cell, transferrin binds to TfRs on the cell surface and the siRNA-containing nanocomplex enters the cell by endocytosis. Inside the cell, chemistry built into the polymer achieves unpackaging of the siRNA from the nanocomplex, permitting it to function via RNA interference.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

Atezolizumab is an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody.

This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-CD27 antibody varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab.

Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 1200 mg of atezolizumab. The first phase of the study will enroll up to 18 patients and test the safety profile of the combination of varlilumab and atezolizumab in patients with various tumor types and determine which dose of varlilumab will be studied in Phase ll* of the study which will enroll only patients with RCC.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of E-602 in subjects with advanced cancers.

Phase 1 of the study consists of dose escalation cohorts of E-602 as a monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. Dose escalation will utilize a modified 3+3 design. Any Phase 1 cohort may be backfilled, up to a total of 15 subjects to obtain additional safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data at a particular dose level. Phase 1 will treat subjects with melanoma, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, gastric/esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer, head and neck cancer, or urothelial cancer. The safety and pharmacodynamic data will be evaluated to identify the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose level for E-602 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab.

Phase 2 consists of dose-expansion disease cohorts in subjects with 3 types of advanced tumors: melanoma, NSCLC, and a third type to be determined (ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, breast, gastric/EGJ, head and neck, or urothelial) based on available data. Phase 2 includes cohorts of E-602 as monotherapy and E-602 in combination with camiplimab. For each cohort in Phase 2, Simon's minimax 2-stage design will be used.

The study is seeking to enroll a total of up to 273 subjects (up to 87 in Phase 1 and up to 186 in Phase 2). Subjects will participate in the study for about 16 months.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Solid Tumor Analysis for HLA Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) and Apheresis for CAR T- Cell Manufacturing</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Objective:

To collect information on how often a solid tumor cancer might lose the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) by next generation sequencing and perform apheresis to collect and store an eligible participant's own T cells for future use to make CAR T-Cell therapy for their disease treatment.

Design:

This is a non-interventional, observational study to evaluate participants with solid tumors with a high risk of relapse for incurable disease. No interventional therapy will be administered on this study. Some of the information regarding the participant's tumor analysis may be beneficial to management of their disease. Participants that meet all criteria may be enrolled and leukapheresed (blood cells collected). The participant's cells will be processed and stored for potential manufacture of CAR T-cell therapy upon relapse of their cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Background:

Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is a protein on the outside of cells that allows the immune system to recognize it's own cells as normal and leave them alone or respond if infected with a virus or bacteria, or a tumor cell. HLA might not be expressed normally on cancer cells. This may be why cancer can grow undetected by the immune system and is referred to as a tumor escape mechanism. Tumor escape can occur for many reasons, but one reason is Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). LOH is the loss of one of the genes that encodes HLA protein. A2 Biotherapeutics, Inc. (A2 Bio) is developing therapies to recognize, target, and kill cancer cells that do not express HLA normally, and minimize any damage to normal cells that express normal HLA.

Once participants are identified as having LOH on their tumors, apheresis, a procedure to separate and collect white blood cells will be performed. It is the first required step in manufacturing CAR T-cell therapy. The collected T cells will be stored for patients that are likely to benefit from CAR T-cell therapy during their disease care.

Study Design:

Approximately 1000 participants will be screened for part 1 of the study, including HLA typing, approximately 500 participants will have NGS testing on their tumor samples and be followed for up to 2 years on the study, and up to 200 participants will be screened for part 2 of the study and enrolled if eligible and apheresed and be followed for up to 2 years on the study.

Participants will be screened (Part 1) for HLA type, and based on results, participants will have archived tumor tissue tested by next generation sequencing (NGS) and be followed for up to 2 years. Based on the tumor NGS results, participants will be apheresed (Part 2) for Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) collection to store their T cells for a future interventional study upon relapse.

Each participant will proceed through the following study periods:

Screening (Part 1 and 2)
Enrollment (Apheresis)
Post Apheresis safety follow-up (Day 7)
Two-year long term follow-up</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME. In eyes with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eye's response to bevacizumab treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity. If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients, clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.

Individuals in poor glycemic control who, within the last four months, initiated intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next four months should not be enrolled.

Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the indication being studied at the time of study entry.

• Note: study participants cannot receive another investigational drug while participating in the study.

Known allergy to any component of the study drug or any drug used in the injection prep (including povidone iodine prep).

Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110).

• If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, individual can become eligible.

Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within four months prior to randomization or anticipated use during the study.

• These drugs cannot be used during the study.

For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant within the next 24 months.

• Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is needed.

Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not covered by another clinical center during the next two years.

Study Eye Criteria The study participant must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed below.

Study participants can have two study eyes only if both eyes are eligible at the time of randomization. For study participants with two eligible eyes, the logistical complexities of the protocol must be considered for each individual prior to randomizing both eyes.

The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:

Inclusion

Best corrected Electronic-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity letter score &lt; 69 (i.e., 20/50 or worse) and ≥ 24 (i.e., 20/320 or better) within eight days of randomization.
On clinical exam, definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema involving the center of the macula.

Diabetic macular edema present on optical coherence tomography (OCT) within eight days of randomization

Zeiss Cirrus central subfield: ≥ 290µm in women or ≥ 305µm in men
Heidelberg Spectralis central subfield: ≥ 305µm in women or ≥ 320µm in men
Investigator must verify accuracy of OCT scan by ensuring it is centered and of adequate quality

Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and individual cooperation sufficient for adequate fundus photographs.

Exclusions

The following exclusions apply to the study eye only (i.e., they may be present for the nonstudy eye):

Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

• An eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.

An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).
An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.).
Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

History of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) in the past 12 months or history of any other treatment for DME at any time in the past four months (such as focal/grid macular photocoagulation, intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids).

• Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample size with any history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Once this number of eyes has been enrolled, any history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME will be an exclusion criterion.

History of pan-retinal photocoagulation within four months prior to randomization or anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six months following randomization.
History of anti-VEGF treatment for a disease other than DME in the past 12 months.
History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior four months or anticipated within the next six months following randomization.
History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months prior to randomization.
Aphakia.
Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or significant blepharitis.
Evidence of uncontrolled glaucoma. • Intraocular pressure must be &lt;30, with no more than one topical glaucoma medication, and no documented glaucomatous field loss for the eye to be eligible

Note, combination therapies are considered more than one medication</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This study is in 2 parts.

The main aims of the 1st part of the study are to check if people with advanced solid tumors or cancers in the immune system (lymphomas) have side effects from TAK-981, and to check how much TAK-981 they can receive without getting side effects from it.

The main aims of the 2nd part of the study are to learn if the condition of people with specific cancers improves after treatment with TAK-981. Another aim is to check for side effects from TAK-981.

In the 1st part of the study, participants will receive TAK-981. In the 2nd part of the study, participants with specific tumor types will receive TAK-981 at the recommended phase 2 dose determined during the 1st part of the study.

In both parts of the study, participants can receive TAK-981 for up to 1 year or longer if their condition stays improved. Participants will receive TAK-981 through vein.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The study will include 2 phases: Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts (cancer treatment expansions).

The study will enrol approximately 202 participants, approximately 70 participants in the dose escalation phase, approximately 132 participants in cancer treatment expansion phase.

In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and pharmacodynamic data and will also determine the single agent RP2D. Participants in dose expansion phase will be enrolled, once RP2D is determined. There will be 6 cohorts in cancer treatment expansions.

Cohort A: Nonsquamous NSCLC
Cohort B: Cervical cancer
Cohort C: MSS-CRC
Cohort D: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL progressed or relapsed after CAR T-cells therapy
Cohort E: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that have not received prior cellular therapy
Cohort F: Relapsed/refractory FL

This multi-center trial will be conducted in European Union, China and United States. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 2 years. The overall time to receive treatment in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year. Based on decision of sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical benefit can continue treatment beyond 1 year. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of drug or before the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up assessment.uroped</FieldValue>

Population for Phase 1 dose escalation:

Has histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (local regionally recurrent not amenable to curative therapy) or metastatic solid tumors who have no standard therapeutic option with a proven clinical benefit, are intolerant, or have refused them. OR
Has relapsed/refractory lymphoma not amenable to therapies with proven clinical benefit or who are intolerant or who refuse them. Participants with low-grade lymphomas such as FL, small lymphocytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphomas, may not need to exhaust all available therapy. These participants can be enrolled after failure of at least 2 prior systemic therapies, provided that there is not an immediate need for cytoreduction. In these cases, participants who need immediate therapy for tumor bulk are not eligible for this trial.

Population for Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts:

o Has histologically or cytologically documented, advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) cancer as listed below, that is incurable and for which prior standard first-line treatment has failed: Note: Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy included in initial treatment may not be considered first- or later-line SOC treatment unless such treatments were completed less than 12 months before the current tumor recurrence.

o Nonsquamous NSCLC that has progressed to 1 prior systemic immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI)/anti-PD-(1/L1)-containing therapy and no more than 2 lines of therapy. Participants must have not shown evidence of tumor progression during the first 5 months of treatment with first-line CPI/anti-PD-(1/L1)-containing therapy (cohort A).

Note: Participants with known driver mutations/genomic aberrations (example- epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], B-Raf proto-oncogene mutation V600E [BRAF V600E], and ROS proto-oncogene 1 [ROS1] sensitizing mutations, neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase [NRTK] gene fusions, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] rearrangements) must have also shown progressive disease after treatment with a commercially available targeted therapy.

o CPI-naïve cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix) participants who have received no more than 1 prior systemic line of therapy for recurrent or Stage IVB cervical cancer (cohort B).

Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma malignum, gastric-type adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, and mesonephric carcinoma. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology report.

Note: First-line treatment must have consisted of platinum-containing doublet. Chemotherapy administered concurrently with primary radiation (example- weekly cisplatin) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.

o CPI-naïve MSS-CRC participants who have progressed on no more than 3 chemotherapy regimens (cohort C).

Note: Participants must have received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing regimens if indicated.

Relapsed/refractory DLBCL progressed or relapsed after prior CAR T cell therapy that has received approval by a health authority for the treatment of DLBCL (cohort D).
Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that has progressed or relapsed after at least 2 but no more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy and has not received prior cellular therapy. At least one prior line of therapy must have included a CD20-targeted therapy (cohort E).
Relapsed/refractory FL that has progressed or relapsed after at least 2 but no more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. At least 1 prior line of therapy must have included a CD20-targeted therapy (cohort F).

In Phase 2 only, have at least 1 radiologically measurable lesion based on RECIST v1.1 for participants with solid tumors or Lugano criteria for lymphoma. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

Note: In Phase 2 stage 1, have an additional lesion for pretreatment and on-treatment biopsy.

In Phase 2 stage 1, willing to consent to mandatory pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy.

Note: For fresh tumor biopsies, the lesion must be accessible for a biopsy procedure as assessed by the investigator.

Is willing to provide archival tumor tissue sample, if available.

        <FieldValue>All subjects will receive a single 30 minute IV infusion of enfortumab vedotin once weekly for the first 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks.

This is a 3 part study. Part A will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in subjects with histologically confirmed malignant solid tumors (excluding sarcomas) that are resistant or have recurred. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Part A will follow a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).

Part B, will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in 3 different expansion cohorts: 1) Urothelial cancer subjects with renal insufficiency defined as a Creatinine Clearance ≥ 15 ml/min and &lt; 30 ml/min, 2) subjects with Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and 3) subjects with Metastatic Ovarian Cancer. With the exception of the renal insufficiency cohort, enrollment into Part B will occur at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part A. Enrollment into the renal insufficiency cohort will begin at starting dose and escalated using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of enfortumab vedotin or consent withdrawal.

Part C will evaluate enfortumab vedotin at the RP2D (determined from Part A) in subjects who have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in the metastatic setting. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal.

All subjects will be followed post-treatment through the 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a Phase 1/2 open-label, multi-center, multi-national study with an initial dose escalation part to determine the RP2D of MCLA-158 single agent in patients with mCRC.

The dose escalation part has been completed and the RP2D will be further evaluated in an expansion part of the study. Cohorts of selected solid tumor indications for which there is evidence of EGFR dependency and potential sensitivity to EGFR inhibition will be evaluated.

The study will further assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of MCLA-158.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Study Design:

This open label, multicenter, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 studying patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort studying MCLA-158 in colorectal cancer and other solid tumor indications.

In the dose escalation part, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with up to 4 lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting (including oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, with or without an anti-angiogenic and with or without an anti-EGFR if RAS wild-type (RASwt)) were treated. The dose escalation part has been completed and the RP2D will be further evaluated in the expansion part of the study.

In the expansion part, MCLA-158 will be administered at the RP2D in metastatic colorectal patients and selected non-colorectal indications in advanced solid tumors. The expansion part will further characterize the safety, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of single-agent MCLA-158 will be in all patients, and retrospective biomarker analyses including EGFR and LGR5 status will be performed.

The study consists of three periods: Screening (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); Treatment (first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow-up (through 30 days after the last dose and and quarterly checks for survival data up to 12 months).</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Collecting and studying tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies collecting tissue samples from patients with HIV-related malignancies.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

To obtain high-quality, clinically annotated tissue from patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 malignancy.
To study clinical, genetic, and immunologic parameters that have prognostic significance and/or are involved in the initiation and progression of HIV-1 malignancies, including complete genomic sequence determination of HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, lung cancer, anal cancer, and cervical cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo tumor, lymph node, bone marrow, or skin biopsy, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells collection. Samples are submitted to the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) Biorepository and transferred to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR). Samples are then analyzed by the Genome Science Center of British Columbia (GSC-BC) and the HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) for full genomic sequencing analysis that may include, but are not limited to, array-based gene expression profiling, comparative genome hybridization, and single nucleotide polymorphism studies by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. Patients' clinical data, demographics, and treatment given are also collected prospectively in order to record treatment outcome and toxicity.

Patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years for data-reporting purposes.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

Participants must have a diagnosis of a malignancy or clinical findings suggestive of a possible HIV-associated malignancy of one of three types:

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Non-small cell lung malignancy

The presence of any of the following conditions will exclude a participant from study enrollment:

Absence of sufficient diagnostic tumor-biopsy tissue material to meet the protocol requirements for baseline specimen submission (minimum specimen size of 10 x 10 x 2 mm); repeat tumor biopsy will not be performed solely to meet the protocol specimen-collection requirements
Participants whose biopsies, for the purpose of this protocol, show a diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
Prior treatment for the study malignancy (including neo-adjuvants), since treatment can affect the mutational spectra of tumors
HIV infection based on serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive western blot, or any other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved (licensed) HIV test; alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests

PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

Participants must be willing and able to sign an IRB-approved informed consent document

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGA271 when given by intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with refractory cancer. The study will also evaluate how long MGA271 stays in the blood and how long it takes for it to leave the body, what is the highest dose that can safely be given, and whether it may have an effect on tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>An open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1, dose-escalation study will be conducted to define the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and potential antitumor activity of MGA271 in patients with refractory cancer that expresses B7-H3.

In the initial segments of the study, patients will be monitored for a minimum of four weeks after administration of the final dose of MGA271. Study assessments will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, PK analysis of serum MGA271, determination of the serum concentration of soluble MGA271 and tumor markers, and an assessment of potential anti-MGA271 antibody [human anti-human antibody (HAHA)] response.

Tumor response assessments using Study Day 43 CT scans or MRI will be performed approximately six weeks after the first MGA271 dose for each patient. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit (partial or complete response or stable disease by RECIST or RANO Response criteria) will be allowed to continue therapy at the same dose, or at a reduced dose if warranted by dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or significant AE in Cycle 1. Subsequent cycles which will begin on Study Day 50 will consist of MGA271 administration on Study Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, with tumor evaluation every other cycle. Responding patients may receive continued antibody therapy until evidence of progression of disease is documented or the patient experiences DLT.

In the Expansion Segment of the study, patients will receive weekly, uninterrupted infusions with an initial response assessment at 8 weeks. Tumor evaluation will be carried out by both RECIST and immune-related response criteria (irRC).</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This trial will look at a drug called SGN-B6A to find out whether it is safe for people who have solid tumors. It will study SGN-B6A to find out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study whether SGN-B6A works to treat solid tumors.

The study will have four parts.

Part A of the study will find out how much SGN-B6A should be given to participants.
Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SGN-B6A is and if it works to treat solid tumors.
Part C of the study will find out whether SGN-B6A is safe to use with pembrolizumab.
Part D will use the dose(s) found in Part C to find out more about how safe SGN-B6A is with pembrolizumab. Part D will also look at whether SGN-B6A with pembrolizumab works to treat solid tumors.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study of ALT-836 in combination with standard of care gemcitabine in participants who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Tissue Factor (TF) is over-expressed in most cancer types. Results from many recent studies have suggested a key role for TF in the development of cancer-associated thrombosis, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. ALT-836, a recombinant human-chimeric monoclonal antibody, is designed as a direct TF antagonist to block TF displayed by cancers and to inhibit cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. In numerous pre-clinical studies in laboratory animals, including non-human primates, ALT-836 exhibits potent anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities with a remarkable safety profile. In humans, ALT-836, administered as a single bolus and monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), is safe and exhibits anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory effects. A Phase II study using a multi-dose regimen of ALT-836 is being conducted in patients with ALI/ARDS. In the dose-escalation study described in this protocol, the investigators will assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ALT-836 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced malignancies known to overexpress TF and in which venous thromboembolism is a major complication.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body), and anti-tumor activities of STM 434 (an inhibitor of activin A) in patients with ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 3 phases (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3). In the first part of the study (Part 1), which will enroll patients with multiple solid tumor types, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STM 434 will be determined for use in the second and third parts of the study (Parts 2 and 3). In the second part (Part 2), which will enroll patients with ovarian cancer, STM 434 will be administered alone, and in the third part (Part 3), which will enroll patients with ovarian cancer, STM 434 will be given together with a chemotherapy called liposomal doxorubicin. Doses of STM 434 (starting at 0.25 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg/kg) will be taken on one of three dosing schedules to determine the MTD. Patients will continue taking STM 434 until their tumor progresses. Serial blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing and safety will be monitored throughout the study.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Gathering information about how often problems with neurocognitive functioning occur in patients with newly diagnosed upper aerodigestive tract cancers may help doctors learn more about the disease.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying neurocognitive functioning in patients with newly diagnosed upper aerodigestive tract cancers receiving treatment at Henry-Joyce Cancer Clinic.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To establish an estimate of the prevalence of baseline neurocognitive impairment prior to initiation of outpatient cancer treatment.
To establish an estimate of the incidence of neurocognitive impairment during outpatient cancer treatment.
To describe how neurocognitive functioning changes over time during cancer treatment.

Secondary

To identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with neurocognitive impairment.
To examine health-related outcomes associated with neurocognitive impairment.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo interview to complete measures of domain-specific neurocognitive functioning, global neurocognitive functioning, subjective neurocognitive functioning, delirium, physical functioning, symptom prevalence and distress, mood states, and medications at baseline before initiation of cancer treatment, at scheduled treatment visits, and at the follow-up visit 3 months after completion of cancer treatment.

Measures of comorbidity, alcohol use, sensory functioning (vision and hearing), and sociodemographic are completed at baseline only. Cancer-related information (diagnosis, staging, and sites of metastasis, if applicable), treatment-related information (planned treatment regimen - chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy), and current medications are obtained at baseline by medical record review.

Health service use and complications are assessed at each scheduled treatment visit and at the 3-month post-treatment follow-up visit. Measures of domain-specific neurocognitive functioning, coping, and quality of life are completed at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up visit.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The 1100 study is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation and expansion prospective clinical study to assess the safety of intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The 1100 study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy in three cohorts of patients in dose escalation and expansion parts. The Escalation Cohort 1 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion in a previously irradiated field. In Escalation Cohorts 2 and 3, patients present with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.

The Expansion cohort 1 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion located either in head and neck area or in lung or liver, who are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. The Expansion cohort 2 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion located either in head and neck area or in lung or liver, who are naive to anti-PD-1 therapy.

The Expansion Cohort 3 includes patients with inoperable NSCLC, malignant melanoma, HCC, RCC, urothelial cancer, cervical cancer or TNBC with metastases to lungs, liver or soft tissue and who are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy.

These patients have a high unmet need and the Sponsor hypothesizes that NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will act synergistically with anti-PD-1 to enhance the therapeutic index of radiotherapy maximizing local effect, to overcome radio-resistance, to increase the local efficacy of immunotherapy, and to improve distant tumor control via an abscopal effect. Eligible patients will receive a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 subsequently activated by radiotherapy and then an approved anti-PD-1. The end of treatment visit will take place 4 weeks after the last radiotherapy fraction. Patients will be followed for long-term safety and efficacy for 2 years after the EOT visit.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAB004 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies, including lymphoma, and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose.

The secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab and to describe the PK profile of toripalimab when administered with TAB004, 2) evaluate antitumor activity of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab; and 3) determine the immunogenicity of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab and to determine the immunogenicity of toripalimab when administered with TAB004.

The exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of TAB004 on its target receptor BTLA, as well as effects on the immune system; 2) evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity of TAB004 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab; 3) evaluate the utility of BTLA ligand, herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM), and additional exploratory biomarkers that could aid in selection of appropriate subjects for TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB004, a recombinant humanized IgG4κ monoclonal antibody specific to BTLA when administered alone and in combination with toripalimab, a human IgG4k monocloncal antibody that specifically binds to the programmed death 1 (PD-1). It is estimated that up to 499 subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies (i.e.; non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), or other tumors), including lymphoma will be enrolled in the study.

Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor, including lymphoma.

The study has 4 parts; Part A dose-escalation, Part B cohort expansion, Part C dose-escalation and Part D cohort expansion. In Part A, up to 24 subjects will be enrolled who must have received, or be ineligible for, or intolerant of, all available approved or standard therapies know to confer clinical benefit including immunotherapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.

In Part B, C and D, subjects must have received at least one line of therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, but are not required to have received all standard therapies known to confer clinical benefit.

Part A is the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four TAB004 dose levels are planned and include: 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 21 days in the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing.

Part B is the monotherapy cohort expansion portion of the study and will consist of up to 50 subjects in each advanced solid tumor indication (up to 200 subjects) that may include but not be limited to lymphoma, melanoma, NSCLC, or other tumors with agreement of the Sponsor.

Part C is the combination therapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four dose levels are planned as follows: Cohort 1 - TAB004 20 mg and toripalimab 240mg; Cohort 2 - TAB004 70 mg and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 3 -TAB004 200 mg and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 4- TAB004 500 mg and toripalimab 240 mg. Part C will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned doses every 21 days in the absence of a DLT that would prevent further dosing.

Part D is the combination therapy cohort expansion portion of the study. Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in each advanced solid tumor indication (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, UC, lymphoma) (up to 250 subjects). Doses of TAB004 and toripalimab will be determined based upon safety and efficacy data from Part C.

Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), or the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017.

In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be allowed to continue TAB004 (Part A and B) or TAB004 and toripalimab (Part C and D) administration every 21 days for up to 2 years.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB004 doses are 0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, 20mg, 70mg, 200mg and 500mg. Toripalimab dose is 240mg. TAB004 alone or TAB004 plus toripalimab will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first dose and may be decreased at the investigators discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.

SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence and severity of adverse events.

Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Blockade of BTLA pathway and PD-1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies has been demonstrated in several syngeneic mouse models to enhance specific T cell responses and inhibit tumor growth. In studies of BTLA deficient mice, diseases such as asthma, autoimmune involvement of the central nervous system, and systemic lupus erythematosus were exacerbated. Particular attention will be given to symptoms related to those diseases. The occurrence of adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, severe skin reactions, endocrinopathies, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs) will be evaluated for subjects receiving TAB004 alone or in combination with toripalimab.

An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include best overall response, objective response rate, duration of response or duration of stable disease, progression free survival and overall response.

PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, AUC0-21d, Cmax, Cmin trough, Tmax, t1/2, CL, accumulation and Vss.

STATISTICAL METHODS Part A and Part C are based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements. In Part B and Part D, sample size is estimated using Simon's two-phase design minimax method.

All PK/Pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity, and safety data will be summarized and presented by cohort as well as overall for the study, using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequencies and percentages for discrete variables.

ORR and the associated 2-sided 95% exact confidence limits will be calculated. The proportion of subjects who have experienced best response as CR, PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD) will be provided by cohorts in Part B and Part D.</FieldValue>

This study will evaluate the safety and activity of escalating doses of CDX-1127 in patients with B-cell and T-cell hematologic malignancies known to express CD27 and solid tumors that are more likely to be responsive to the immune system.

Eligible patients who enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of 5 dose levels of CDX-1127. This first phase of the study will test the safety profile of CDX-1127 and will assess which dose to test in future studies.

During the Expansion phase, cohorts of approximately 15 patients each will receive the study treatment to continue to evaluate the safety profile of CDX-1127 and to determine if it has an effect on their cancer. Expansion cohorts may be limited to one or more tumor types.

Patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment for up to 5 cycles, until their disease has progressed or until it is necessary to stop the treatment for safety or other reasons.

All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is responding to treatment and for any side effects that may occur.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This was a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with dovitinib (TKI258) in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological malignancies that have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have mutations, translocations or amplifications and whose disease has progressed on or after standard treatment.

Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. As such, more patients have been identified with potentially-actionable mutations, translocations or amplifications but do not have access to targeted drug treatment. This is a signal-seeking study to match patients with tumor pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib to the RTK inhibitor dovitinib. Pre-identification of mutations, translocations, or amplifications will be performed locally at a CLIA certified laboratory prior to participation on the trial.

For the purpose of this study, genomic profiling is not considered part of screening. Informed consent must be signed before any screening activities take place. Once eligibility (screening criteria met) has been confirmed by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy with dovitinib single-agent. The patient may not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy during treatment with dovitinib.

Patients received study treatment until disease progression (assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent, start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise known as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease progression must have their progression clearly documented.

Disease assessment (by RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response criteria) will be performed every 8 weeks (±4 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd cycle), until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first. The frequency of disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at least 4 post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML patients). Scans was assessed locally by the investigator. After discontinuation of treatment, patients, regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety for 30 days after the last dose.

All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last patient has enrolled in the study,regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up)</FieldValue>

Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing was not mandatory).
Patients who received investigational agents within ≤ 5t1/2 of the agent (or ≤ 4 weeks when half-life was unknown) prior to starting study drug.
Patient with history of non-compliance to medical regimen.
Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.

Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they were using highly effective methods of contraception (defined below). Highly effective contraception had to be used by both sexes (female patients and their male partners) during study treatment and for 30 days after the last doseof study medication.

Highly effective contraception methods included:

Total abstinence (when this was in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post- ovulation methods) and withdrawal were not acceptable methods of contraception
Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.

In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner was the sole partner for that subject.

Combination of the following (a+b):

Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository
Oral, implantable, or injectable hormone contraceptives might be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and were therefore not considered effective for this study Women of child-bearing potential (sexually mature women) who had not undergone a hysterectomy or who were not naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug.
Post-menopausal women were allowed to participate in this study. Women were considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to entry in the study. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment, then she was considered not of child bearing potential.
Fertile males not willing to use contraception. Fertile males must use condom with spermicide. Highly effective contraception, as defined above, was to be used by both sexes (male patients and their female partners) during study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study medication and was not to father a child in this period. A condom was required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as RAV12, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RAV12 in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of RAV12 in patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma.
Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.
Determine the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.
Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

Patients receive RAV12 IV over 2 hours 2-3 times per week in weeks 1-4 (course 1). Patients are evaluated for response on day 43. Patients achieving a partial or complete response may be eligible to receive additional courses of RAV12 as above. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of RAV12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 15 additional patients are treated at the MTD in 1 or more patients groups (e.g., colorectal, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, and other adenocarcinoma).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 4 weeks and then every 6-12 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Dose Escalation Study of ARQ 197 in Combination With Sorafenib in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of ARQ 197 administered orally in combination with sorafenib.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The study is only enrolling patients in the expanded cohorts with hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer.

Enrollment of an initial patient cohort of 3 or 6 patients will follow the traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation scheme. These patients will be treated with ARQ 197 and sorafenib at Dose Level 1 (ARQ 197 360 mg BID and sorafenib 200 mg BID). Enrollment of subsequent patient cohort(s) will depend on the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment in the initial cohort. If &lt;33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLT) by the end of first treatment cycle (4 weeks), then next cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 2 (ARQ 197 360 mg BID and sorafenib 400 mg BID). If ≥ 33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience DLT(s) by the end of first treatment cycle, the next cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 0 (ARQ 197 240 mg BID and sorafenib 200 mg BID).

Additional treatment cohorts may be enrolled to explore intermediate, higher or lower doses of ARQ 197, as indicated by the tolerability, safety profile, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile.

Intra-patient dose-escalation from Dose Level 1 to Dose Level 2 may occur in patients enrolled in Dose Level 1 after they complete at least 1 cycle of treatment without DLT and other drug-related adverse event that, in the opinions of Investigator and Medical Monitor, is serious and medically significant.

Once a safe and recommended dose level is determined, an expanded cohort (Expansion Cohort 1) of up to 40 patients with either unresectable HCC or advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), for whom sorafenib is indicated, will be enrolled and treated at this dose level (expansion portion). Up to 20 patients with unresectable HCC and up to 20 patients with advanced RCC may be enrolled in this protocol (including patients in dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort).

An additional expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 2) of up to 40 patients with breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma will be enrolled and treated at MTD/RP2D. Up to 10 patients may be enrolled for breast and non-small cell lung cancer and up to 20 patients with melanoma (at least 10 of whom must have NRAS mutation).

Under Amendment #3, newly enrolled subjects with HCC will be given ARQ 197 at 240 mg BID as starting dose. If a patient with HCC tolerates this starting dose for at least one cycle, the investigator may increase his/her dose to 360 mg BID.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a first time in human (FTIH), open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of GSK3174998 administered intravenously to participants with selected advanced or recurrent solid tumors. This dose-escalation study will assess the safety, activity of GSK3174998 as monotherapy (Part 1), in combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2), and potentially in combination with additional therapies.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts, each part consisting of starting with a dose-escalation phase followed by a cohort expansion phase. GSK3174998 will first be evaluated as monotherapy in escalating doses. Once a dose of GSK3174998 has been identified that is both tolerable and demonstrates pharmacodynamic activity, enrollment of Part 2 may begin. In Part 2, escalating doses of GSK3174998 will be evaluated with fixed doses of pembrolizumab.

The maximum duration of treatment with GSK3174998 and pembrolizumab will be approximately 2 years or 35 cycles, whichever comes first. The follow-up period for safety assessments will be a minimum of 3 months from the date of the last dose. The post-treatment follow-up period will include disease assessments every 12 weeks until documented progressive disease (PD). Approximately 141 participants with selected advanced or recurrent solid tumors will be enrolled.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-279252 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The study design consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts. In the dose escalation phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels. During dose escalation, two possible schedules for administration of SL-279252 may be explored. The MTD or MAD may be determined for either schedule. Based on accumulating data from the dose escalation phase, including safety, PK, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity, up to two dose expansion cohorts may be opened. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to further refine the safety and tolerability of SL-279252. The expansion cohorts will evaluate one or two doses of SL-279252 using one selected schedule. At the end of dose escalation and dose expansion, safety, PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to identify the RP2D.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cetuximab works in treating patients with recurrent or stage IIIB or stage IV lung cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or stage IIIB or IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or adenocarcinoma of the lung with BAC features treated with cetuximab.

Secondary

Determine the overall survival and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.
Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
Correlate expression of total and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), total and phosphorylated AKT3, and total and phosphorylated MAPKinase with response in patients treated with this drug.
Determine whether the presence of polymorphisms or mutations in the EGFR gene influences response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

        <FieldValue>This was an open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with ceritinib in patients with a diagnosis of solid tumors or hematological malignancies that had been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have ALK or ROS1 positive mutations, translocations, rearrangements or amplifications and whose disease had progressed on or after standard treatment. The study consisted of a treatment phase where all patients received ceritinib capsules for a total dose of 750 mg daily for up to 8 cycles of 28 days. Disease assessments for clinical benefit were performed every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment for any reason, patients were followed for safety for 30 days. Survival information was collected every 3 months until 2 years after the last patient had enrolled into the study. Study was amended to allow for discontinuation of survival period if primary endpoint was not met.

        <FieldValue>Patients who are never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and have relapsed after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) will be eligible for enrollment. The trial will proceed in two stages. In the safety lead-in stage, 6 patients will be enrolled and treated with the LP-300 co-administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed. In the absence of any safety signals in these patients, the second stage of the trial protocol will begin. This second stage consists of randomizing patients in a 2:1 allocation ratio to one of two arms: investigational arm of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and LP-300 or the standard of care arm of carboplatin and pemetrexed. Treatment of both groups will be on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. A total of 4 to 6 treatment cycles are planned (number of cycles determined by PI discretion), with the possibility of patients going into a pemetrexed maintenance phase afterwards.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>A Study of ASP3082 in Adults With Previously Treated Solid Tumors</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene. The so-called G12D mutation in the KRAS gene is common in people with some solid tumors.

ASP3082 is a potential new treatment for certain solid tumors in people who have the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. Before ASP3082 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how it is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and to check for potential medical problems from the treatment.

People in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene (G12D mutation). Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They will have been previously treated with standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.

The 2 main aims of the study are: to check the safety of ASP3082 by itself and together with cetuximab (a common cancer medicine), how well it is tolerated, and to find a suitable dose of ASP3082 by itself and together with cetuximab.

This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP3082.

This study will be in 2 parts. In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP3082, by itself, or together with cetuximab. Only people with colorectal cancer will receive ASP3082 together with cetuximab. Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP3082. A medical expert panel will check the results from this group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP3082. The panel will do this for each group until all groups have received ASP3082 (by itself or together with cetuximab) or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.

In Part 2, other different small groups of people will receive ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab, with the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP3082 to use in future studies.

ASP3082, and cetuximab (if used), will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long. They will continue treatment until: they have medical problems from the treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; they ask to stop treatment; they do not come back for treatment.

People will visit the clinic on certain days during their treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of treatment. During these visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab. At some visits, other checks will include a medical examination, blood and urine tests and vital signs. Vital signs include temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. (Blood oxygen levels will also be checked for people treated with ASP3082 together with cetuximab.) Tumor samples will be taken during certain visits during treatment and when treatment has finished.

People will visit the clinic within 7 days after stopping treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab. Other checks will include a medical examination, urine and blood tests and vital signs. After this, people will continue to visit the clinic every 9 weeks. This is to check the condition of their cancer. They will do this until 45 weeks after treatment stopped, or if their cancer is worse, they start other cancer treatment, they ask to stop treatment, or they do not come back for treatment.

Also, people may visit the clinic at 30 days and 90 days after stopping treatment. At the 30-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab. People will have their vital signs checked and have some blood tests. At the 90-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP3082 by itself or together with cetuximab and people will have their vital signs checked.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This is a first in human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1-2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of AU-007 with or without aldesleukin, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cancer. Patients must either be ineligible for or have progressed on prior standard of care therapy. Phase 1 consists of 3 escalation Arms, each starting with a single 1+2 escalation cohort followed by 3+3 escalation cohorts to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study begins in Arm A evaluating escalating doses of AU-007 (Q2w) in sequential escalation cohorts to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Arm B, AU-007 (Q2w) is evaluated in combination with a single dose of aldesleukin given with the first AU-007 dose. AU-007 is administered at a fixed dose (Q2w) with an escalating single aldesleukin dose in sequential escalation cohorts. In Arm C, AU-007 is evaluated in combination with aldesleukin both given Q2w. AU-007 will be administered at a fixed dose with an escalating dose of aldesleukin in each sequential Arm C escalation cohort. The Phase 2, cohort expansion portion of the study consists of three expansion Arms evaluating the initial efficacy of the RP2D from corresponding dose escalation Arms A, B, and C in selected solid tumor types.

        <FieldValue>The TRANSLATE study aims to better understand why tumors become resistant to standard anti-cancer therapies.

New tumor biopsy and blood samples are collected after disease progression on standard-of-care anti-cancer treatment and compared to the initial (archival) tumor biopsy sample taken from the same patient.

Annotated reports of results from clinical Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) gene panel tests of both tumor and blood are sent directly from the testing lab to the study physician for discussion with the patient during the study.

Patients may participate in interventional treatment clinical trials at the same time as participating in the TRANSLATE study.

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Background: Development of new cancer treatments requires better understanding of why tumors develop resistance to standard-of-care (SOC) therapies. However, post-progression tumor biopsies are not routinely collected, limiting the tissue available to characterize mechanisms of treatment resistance. The TRANSLATE clinical study is specifically designed to address these critical gaps.

Trial design: TRANSLATE is a global, multicenter, translational study designed to collect and compare archival pre-treatment tumor tissue with paired de novo tumor and blood samples obtained following disease progression on SOC therapies, targeting therapeutically important areas of cancer biology.

Eligible Tumor Type and Most Recent SOC Therapy:

Non-small-cell lung and Anti-PD-1/-L1 monotherapy
Non-small-cell lung and Anti-PD-1/-L1 + platinum
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma and Anti-PD-1/-L1 monotherapy
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma and Doublet anti-PD-1/-L1 + anti-CTLA-4
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma and Pembrolizumab + axitinib
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma and Avelumab + axitinib
HR+ HER2- breast and Palbociclib + hormonal therapy
germline mutated BRCA breast and Olaparib or talazoparib monotherapy
Castration-resistant prostate and Enzalutamide
Castration-resistant prostate and Abiraterone + prednisone

Eligibility criteria include adults with locally advanced or metastatic tumors; radiographic evidence of progressive disease during the most recent SOC regimen; sufficient archival tumor tissue; and a post-progression tumor lesion that is safely accessible for a new biopsy.

The results from clinical NGS panel testing may help inform subsequent treatment plan or identification of relevant interventional clinical trials.

Patients are enrolled after disease progression on SOC and before change in treatment and participate in 3 study visits within approximately 3 months.

Next-generation sequencing results from analysis of tumor tissue and blood will be returned to the study physician and patient for review at a subsequent study visit within this timeframe.

The primary endpoint is the change in frequency of gene alterations between pre-treatment and post-progression tumor biopsies. Secondary endpoints address prioritized scientific hypotheses specific to each target area of biology and indication.

Primary data will be publicly available after the study to support further research.

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

NOTE: An administrative decision was made by NCI to halt further study of vorinostat in this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013. No patients remain on vorinostat. Going forward this study will determine the safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient population.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in solid tumor patients with HIV infection.

II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination in this patient population.

*NOTE: An administrative decision was made by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to halt further study of vorinostat in this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013, and no patients remain on vorinostat. The primary objective going forward will determine the safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient population.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To preliminarily assess response rates of the therapeutic combination in lung, head and neck, and esophageal cancers.

II. To evaluate the pathological characteristics of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.

III. To determine the presence and oncogenic activity of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in tumor tissues and to correlate HPV infection with clinical outcomes.

IV. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by an expansion cohort study.

Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies and HIV viral load analysis.

Note: An administrative decision was made by CTEP to halt further study of vorinostat in this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013. No patients remain on vorinostat. The primary objective going forward will determine the safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient population, without vorinostat. The information pertaining to vorinostat is for historical purposes.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>Inclusion Criteria:

Patients must have known HIV infection and histologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and is therefore incurable; although the focus of this trial will be on upper aerodigestive cancers (non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and non-gastroesophageal junction esophageal cancer), patients with other incurable solid tumor with disease potentially sensitive to carboplatin and/or taxanes (including but not limited to salivary gland cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or anal cancer, BUT excluding Kaposi sarcoma), will be eligible
Up to 1 prior systemic therapy regimen will be permitted for palliative treatment of metastatic or unresectable relapsed disease; however, previous chemotherapy delivered with curative-intent (i.e., chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant [postoperative] chemotherapy at a time disease was considered potentially curable) will be permitted; prior taxane (including paclitaxel or docetaxel) and/or platinum exposure will be permitted; however, patients must not experience disease progression within 3 months of platinum-based therapy; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy, 6 weeks if the last regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin C; toxicities from prior anticancer therapy must have recovered to =&lt; Grade 1
Serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive Western Blot, or any other federally approved licensed HIV test; a positive HIV viral load prior to study entry will also be permitted
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 50%)
Documented life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks
Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL
Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL
Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL
Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
Additionally, serum magnesium and potassium must be within institutional normal limits, and a CD4 count &gt; 100/mcL will be required within 2 weeks of study participation
Presence of at least one measureable tumor lesion is required
Participating patients must receive medically appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection, including antiretroviral medications, when clinically indicated, and should be under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management; with the exception of treatment with zidovudine and stavudine, patients will be eligible regardless of antiretroviral regimen (no antiretroviral therapy, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTI]-based therapy, or protease inhibitor based therapy), provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been stable for at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks following study entry; the exact regimen used for HIV therapy will be captured on Case Report Forms; as study-specific (antiretroviral therapy-based) strata fill, however, only patients fitting the remaining open strata will be accrued
Because histone deacetylase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during the duration of study participation, and for at least 3 months following study completion; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before initiation of study drug dosing; post menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; (Note: A woman of childbearing potential is one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant; this includes women who are using contraceptives or whose sexual partners are either sterile or using contraceptives)
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document; as the correlative studies are critical to the clinical and scientific value of the trial, CD4 count/HIV viral load determinations will be required, and participation in the tumor-based correlative studies will be strongly recommended; additionally, investigators MUST request sample donation to the AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR); however, the patient may refuse sample donation; patients accrued to the expansion phase of the study will be required to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling
Subjects must in the opinion of the Investigator be capable of complying with this protocol

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (toxicities not improved to =&lt; Grade 1) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; additionally, patients experiencing disease progression within 3 months of platinum-based therapy will be excluded from trial participation
Due to availability of effective first- and second-line therapies (as well as disease-specific clinical trials), patients with diagnosis of active Kaposi sarcoma will be excluded from study participation; however, persons with other active malignancy with prior history of Kaposi sarcoma can be considered for participation at the discretion of the Study Chair
Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents
Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events
History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study agents used in study (including hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, Cremophor, or platins)
For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, inability to take oral medications; vorinostat capsules must be administered whole; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)
As ketoconazole may inhibit paclitaxel metabolism, patients receiving ketoconazole for any treatment indication are ineligible; patients receiving any other medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes will be eligible; however, use all such medications or substances must be documented in the Case Report Forms
For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, prior exposure to vorinostat or other known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer therapy; patients should not have taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor, for at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)
Since zidovudine and stavudine have potential for severe hematological toxicity potentially overlapping with toxicities of the study therapy, treatment with these agents will be disallowed
Due to potential toxicity associated with study therapy (particularly with paclitaxel), patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 will be excluded from study participation
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, opportunistic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; patients with HIV infection will be eligible provided they meet the criteria specified; patients with known Hepatitis B infection should be screened for active disease prior to study participation; patients with chronic Hepatitis C infection will be eligible at the discretion of the treating investigator
Pregnant women are excluded from this study and women who become pregnant while on study must be immediately discontinued; women who are breastfeeding will not be eligible for study participation</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This phase I trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignant neoplasms that have come back (relapsed), do not respond to treatment (refractory), or have distributed over a large area in the body (disseminated). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in HIV-infected patients on effective antiretroviral therapy and with relapsed/refractory or disseminated acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining or non-AIDS defining malignancy.

II. To assess the safety and feasibility of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) administration as first systemic therapy for HIV associated Kaposi sarcoma in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To obtain preliminary insights into clinical benefit (e.g., tumor shrinkage or stabilization &gt;= 24 weeks) across a variety of tumors in patients infected with HIV and on effective antiretroviral therapy.

II. To evaluate the response rate in Kaposi sarcoma impacting physical and/or psychological wellbeing and not amenable to local therapy.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the correlation of pre-therapy tumor PD-L1 expression and T-cell infiltration on clinical benefit.

II. To assess the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV and the HIV viral reservoir in patients on effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), as measured by plasma HIV single copy ribonucleic acid (RNA), CD4+ T-cell associated HIV unspliced RNA, CD4+ T-cell associated integrated HIV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) provirus, ratio of HIV unspliced RNA/DNA, &quot;Tat/Rev induced limiting dilution assay&quot; (TILDA), and phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 molecular evolution.

III. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on host gene expression in circulating blood cells.

IV. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity against autologous HIV infected CD4+ T-cells in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy.

V. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating lymphocyte and monocyte numbers and phenotypes.

VI. To assess biopsied tumors from participants that progress by immunohistochemistry arrays and gene expression analysis to evaluate potential reasons for the lack of response to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or progression such as a lack of T cells within or around tumor.

VII. To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV) viral load in the blood, KSHV seroreactivity and KSHV specific CD8+ T-cell activity.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients continue receiving their recommended combination antiretroviral therapy orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and blood sample collection throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo biopsies during screening and on study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days and then every 12 weeks up to 1 year.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This study is designed to evaluate the ability of intravenously (IV)administered 131-I-labeled TM-601 (chlorotoxin) to provide tumor-specific localization(via radiographic imaging) in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with evidence of metastatic involvement. (Refractory tumors are non-responsive to standard treatment.) The safety and tolerability of IV administered 131-I-TM-601 in this patient population will be evaluated as part of this study.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, sequential, within-patient dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with metastatic involvement (including brain metastases). Patients will be administered 1 to 3 (Test Doses A, B and Dose C) escalating doses of 131-I-TM-601 by intravenous (IV) administration, with dosimetry (imaging-based evaluation of the dose reaching the target sites) conducted prior to and following administration of each dose. Whole body dosimetry on critical structures including, but not limited to, bone marrow, bladder, brain, liver, and thyroid will be determined. The preliminary results from Test Dose Levels (A and/or B) for each patient will be analyzed prior to treating patients with Dose C.

Patients will be followed until 28 days following the final dose, with a complete clinical assessment and imaging evaluations at the final follow-up visit.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Manuka honey may prevent or reduce esophagitis-related pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether Manuka honey is more effective than standard care in preventing pain.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II clinical trial is studying Manuka honey to see how well it works in preventing esophagitis-related pain in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Evaluate the relative efficacy of 4 times a day consumption of liquid or lozenge Manuka honey to delay or prevent radiation esophagitis-related pain (during combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer) as compared to standard supportive treatment, as measured at week 4 by Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) for pain upon swallowing.

Secondary

Evaluate the trend of severity of radiation esophagitis-related pain during combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer using weekly measurements of the NRPS.
Evaluate the adverse events associated with Manuka honey, as measured by CTCAE, v. 4.
Evaluate the severity of radiation esophagitis (grade 3-4, CTCAE, v. 4).
Assess weight loss (percent weight change from baseline to 4 weeks).
Assess quality of life (QOL) and pain, as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-30) global QOL score and pain symptom subscale.
Assess patient-reported dysphagia via a daily patient log.
Assess nutritional status, as measured by the mean change in serum prealbumin levels from baseline to 4 weeks.
Assess opioid use by collecting the patient's narcotic use in the previous 24-hour period at each weekly evaluation.
Evaluate patient-reported adverse events associated with Manuka honey using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the percentage of esophagus in the radiation field (V60 &lt; 30% vs V60 ≥ 30%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

Arm I: Patients receive standard supportive care for esophagitis-related pain as needed during chemoradiotherapy.
Arm II: Patients swallow liquid Manuka honey slowly over 3-5 minutes. Patients must refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4 times per day during chemoradiotherapy.
Arm III: Patients place Manuka honey lozenges in their mouth one at a time and swallow the honey as it dissolves (no chewing or swallowing it whole). Patients must refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4 times per day during chemoradiotherapy.

Patients complete quality of life, pain swallowing diary, and pain assessments (Numerical Rating Pain Scale, EORTC QLQ-30 and Pain Subscale, and PRO-CTCAE) periodically during study treatment.

Patients are followed up at 12 weeks from the start of study treatment.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To establish psychometric properties for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor (FACT-EGFRI 18) module (based on criterion validity, known group's validity, internal consistency reliability, and responsiveness to change) as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of EGFRI-induced skin-related toxicity.

Secondary

To document minimally important differences over time for the FACT-EGFRI 18 by comparing mean changes in this PRO measure to the patient's direct assessment of change using two anchor items (change in skin condition severity and impact).
To examine the association between toxicity profiles (severity and time to onset), and treatment profiles (e.g., delays and discontinuation) and the FACT-EGFRI 18 scores.
To assess degree of concordance between FACT-EGFRI 18 ratings and study site physician CTCAE Version 4.0 EGFRI-Induced Dermatologic Toxicity Grading Assessment ratings.
To evaluate feasibility outcomes.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients complete the S1013 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor (FACT-EGFRI 18) at baseline and prior to beginning therapy and clinical assessment. Patients also complete FACT-EGFRI 18 and the Changes in Skin Symptoms on days 1*, 8**, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 71, 99, and 127. Patients who do not develop any grade of papulopustular rash within 42 days are removed from study.

Investigators performing the patients' clinical assessment complete the EGFRI-Induced Dermatologic Toxicity Grading Assessment on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 71, 99, and 127, and the Treatment Form assessment on days 22, 43, 71, 99, and 127. Nurses or clinical trial administrators (CRA) also complete the S1013 Cover Sheet for Patient Complete Questionnaires accompanying the FACT-EGFRI 18 patients' questionnaires at each schedule assessment.

NOTE: *Patients start EGFRI therapy.

NOTE: **Change in Skin Symptoms questionnaire starts on Day 8.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Gathering information about how often osteonecrosis of the jaw occurs in patients receiving zoledronic acid for bone metastases may help doctors learn more about the disease and provide the best follow-up care.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer who are receiving zoledronic acid for bone metastases.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To prospectively access the cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic acid treatment.

Secondary

To describe the clinical presentation and natural history of ONJ.
To identify potential risk factors for the development of ONJ.
To estimate the cumulative incidence of ONJ at 3 years for different tumor types (i.e., breast cancer, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers).
To better define the patient-related outcomes of ONJ.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo dental assessments at baseline and every 3-6 months for 3 years.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

Participant must have bone metastasis from multiple myeloma, solid tumors, or other malignancy for which intravenous bisphosphonate has clinical indications in the treatment of metastatic bone disease
Treatment with osteoclast inhibition is clinically indicated
Must be planning to receive zoledronic acid* within the next 30 days NOTE: *Osteoclast inhibition therapy will continue thereafter as clinically indicated.
No prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw

Patients previously treated with osteoclast inhibition therapy are eligible, provided the following criteria apply:

Prior osteoclast inhibition for low bone mass (osteoporosis or osteopenia):

Patients may have previously received at most 3 doses of osteoclast-inhibiting therapy with denosumab, IV ibandronate, pamidronate, or zoledronic acid for low bone mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis) within 3 years prior to registration
Prior oral bisphosphonate therapy at osteoporosis or osteopenia dosing at any time prior to registration is allowed
Prior exposures to other medications used to treat low bone mass at osteoporosis or osteopenia dosing are permitted

Prior osteoclast inhibition for metastatic bone disease (tumor involving bone):

Patients may have previously received osteoclast-inhibiting therapy with denosumab, ibandronate (oral or IV cancer dosing), pamidronate, or zoledronic acid to treat metastatic bone disease within 180 days prior to registration

Patients receiving these regimens for metastatic bone disease prior to 180 days before registration are not eligible
Prior osteoclast-inhibiting therapy at higher dosing than outlined above at any time prior to registration is not allowed

PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

Zubrod performance status 0-3

Patients who may be acutely ill from spinal cord compromise, hypercalcemia of malignancy, or other process may be study candidates once the acute condition has been addressed and performance status improves to 0-3
Not pregnant or nursing
Negative pregnancy test
Willing and physically able to comply with study procedures and assessments
Willing to provide information on personal history, including tobacco and alcohol use, and pain assessment
Willing to provide access to prior and future dental information

No other prior malignancy except for any of the following:

Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
In situ cervical cancer
Adequately treated stage I or II cancer for which the patient is currently in complete remission
Any other cancer for which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

See Disease Characteristics
No history of radiation to the maxillofacial area administered for therapeutic intent in the treatment of cancer
Concurrent participation in other therapeutic and non-therapeutic clinical trials allowed
The sum of prior IV bisphosphonate doses must not be greater than 10
The sum of prior denosumab doses must not be greater than 8
The total of both IV bisphosphonate and denosumab used for any indication must not be greater than 12 doses</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Questionnaires that assess symptoms caused by cancer and cancer therapy may help improve the ability to plan treatment for patients with invasive cancer to help them live longer and more comfortably.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying symptoms caused by cancer and cancer therapy in patients with invasive breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the prevalence, severity, and interference due to physical and psychological symptoms experienced (over a 4 to 5 week period) by patients with invasive primary breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer who are being followed on an outpatient basis at ECOG institutions.

Secondary

Determine if the number of symptom-related interventions are related to the providers' perception of symptom severity.
Determine whether physical symptoms are more commonly prioritized and treated compared to psychological symptoms.
Determine the percentage of patients who experience a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe symptoms and characterize the determinants of symptom relief.
Determine the focus and scope of interventions chosen by oncologists to improve the symptom control of patients seen in outpatient clinics.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type, prevalence according to gender, race/ethnicity, age, and type of treatment.

Patients complete the M.D. Anderson Symptom Assessment Inventory and other questionnaires, rating the symptoms most frequently found in this patient group and how much these symptoms interfere with mood and activity-related domains, on day 1 and again between days 28-35.

At the same time points, a healthcare provider (treating physician, nurse, or physician assistant) completes the Revised Edmonton Staging System for Cancer Pain questionnaire, assessing the patient's cancer pain on the basis of mechanism of pain, incidental pain, psychological distress and addictive behavior, and cognitive function, for clinical prognosis on pain control.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,310 patients and their physicians will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Amifostine may be effective in reducing pain, numbness, tingling, and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well amifostine works in reducing pain, numbness, tingling, and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients who have received paclitaxel for solid tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the percentage of patients with solid tumors who have persistent paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy who benefit, defined as a decrease of at least 20% on their FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY/ GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY GROUP NEUROTOXICITY (FACT/GOG-Ntx) FACT-GOG-NTX score, from treatment with subcutaneous amifostine.
Determine whether there is sufficient evidence of reversal activity of this drug in these patients to justify a phase III study.

Secondary

Compare the acute toxic effects of this drug administered subcutaneously in these patients vs IV administrations of this drug historically and/or during the GOG-0192 study.
Determine the capability of the Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test to provide objective, quantitative evidence for improvement in patients who have subjective improvement as self-reported on the FACT-GOG-NTX scale.
Determine whether any benefit in patients treated with this drug is transient or lasts at least 8 weeks.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive amifostine subcutaneously three times weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of symptom progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial response receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy.

Neuropathy symptoms are assessed using the FACT-GOG-NTX questionnaire administered at baseline, weekly during therapy, and at 12 weeks and the Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test administered at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

Patients are followed at 12 weeks.

Treatment with radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study drug administration.
Radioligand (e.g., radium-223) within 6 months prior to initiation of study drug administration for mCRPC in the Cohort Expansion Phase.
Serum testosterone &gt; 50 ng/dl or &gt; 1.7 nmol/L for mCRPC in the Cohort Expansion Phase.
Confirmed or presumed COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection. While SARS-CoV-2 testing is not mandatory for study entry, testing should follow local clinical practice guidelines/standards. Patients with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection, known asymptomatic infection, or presumed infection are excluded. Patients may be considered eligible after a resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection once he or she remains afebrile for at least 72 hours and after other SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms have fully recovered to baseline for a minimum of 72 hours</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Identification of genes that may be associated with developing certain types of cancer may someday provide important information about a person's risk of getting cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying to see if certain genes may be associated with cancer in patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, or colon and siblings of these patients.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Gather allele-sharing statistics at approximately 100 candidate loci throughout the human genome most likely to influence genetic risk of cancer.
Use these allele-sharing statistics to test the interaction of each locus individually with cancer-associated, rare alleles of HRAS1.
Generalize this approach for one of four cancers (breast, colon, lung, or prostate), using allele-sharing statistics to test the interaction of each locus with every other locus.
Replicate positive results in a distinct set of sibling pairs with cancer.
Examine, when loci contributing to risk are detected, the influence of this genetic background on clinical outcomes, such as survival.

OUTLINE: Each patient-sibling pair completes a family history questionnaire about the incidence of cancer in the family. Blood samples are obtained from both the patient and the sibling (and both living parents, if available).

The blood samples are genotyped using approximately 300 micro-satellite markers flanking 100 candidate genes previously implicated in genetic risk for cancer. Certain loci are a priority due to their association with HRAS1: BRCA1 and all known mismatch repair loci; other repair genes, such as ATM; the Bloom's syndrome locus; and the XRCC group. Other genes are also mapped.

Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence the type and duration of treatment.

Patients only are followed annually.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 1,000 patient-sibling pairs for breast cancer. After 18 months, another 1,000 patient-sibling pairs will be accrued for breast cancer. Therefore, up to 2,000 patient-sibling pairs will be accrued over 5 years. (Feasibility of accruing pairs for lung, colon, and prostate cancer is being assessed.)</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>TiTAN-1 is a first-in-human study of GEN-011, an experimental treatment being evaluated in adult patients with advanced cancer. GEN-011 is a T cell therapy made specific to each patient, using the patient's own circulating immune cells. First, Genocea confirms which cancer proteins are recognized already by each patient's T cells using ATLAS™. Then, immune cells that recognize these cancer proteins are multiplied many times (a process called PLANET™) to create a personalized GEN-011 cell therapy, which is given back to the patient in one or more intravenous (IV) infusions.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>TiTAN-1 is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-human Phase 1 study of GEN-011 in patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma (UC, bladder, ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), or anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). Patients will be enrolled into one of 2 cohorts. One cohort will receive a multiple low dose (MLD) regimen of GEN-011 to be given without lymphodepletion, and a second cohort will receive a single high dose (SHD) regimen of GEN-011 after lymphodepletion. Regardless of cohort, each dose of GEN-011 will be followed by a course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as costimulatory therapy.

GEN-011 is an investigational, personalized neoantigen adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that is being developed by Genocea for the treatment of adult patients with advanced solid tumors. A proprietary tool developed by Genocea called ATLAS™ (Antigen Lead Acquisition System) will be used to identify true immunogenic neoantigens from each patient's tumor that are recognized by their own CD4 and/or CD8 T cells. ATLAS-identified neoantigens will be used to stimulate and select autologous T cells collected by apheresis to generate an adoptive cell product ex vivo.</FieldValue>

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Pulmonary rehabilitation education and exercise training may improve physical function and quality of life in patients who are receiving treatment for lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying pulmonary rehabilitation education and exercise training to see how well they work compared to exercise training alone in improving physical function and quality of life in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for locally advanced lung cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Compare improvement in physiologic function, in terms of exercise tolerance, in patients with inoperable locally advanced lung cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy and randomized to pulmonary rehabilitation comprising education with vs without supervised exercise training.
Compare the health-related quality of life, in terms of multidimensional functioning and patient perception of respiratory difficulties, in patients undergoing these pulmonary rehabilitation interventions.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance status (0-1 vs 2); FEV_1 (≥ 70% of predicted vs &lt; 70% of predicted); and smoking status* (never smoked or former smoker vs current smoker). Approximately 20 weeks into treatment on SWOG-S0023, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

NOTE: * Never smoked is defined as &lt; 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and former smoker is defined as no smoking for ≥ 1 year.

Arm I: Patients participate in a supervised structured exercise program (i.e., walking on a treadmill OR using a stationary exercise bicycle) 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Patients also receive educational materials on how to improve breathing and conserve energy.
Arm II: Patients receive educational materials as in arm I. In both arms, patients undergo exercise testing using 6-minute walks to measure exercise tolerance at initial evaluation (after randomization but prior to intervention), 12 weeks, and then at 6 and 9 months.

In both arms, intervention continues in the absence of disease progression or the development of other medical conditions that would preclude study participation.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and then at 6 and 9 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 164 patients (82 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

2.1 History/physical examination within 8 weeks prior to registration; 2.2 Bone scan within 4 weeks prior to registration; bone metastases must be visible on the scan. Other scanning modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) 2.3 Dental evaluation according to the dental exam checklist (carried out by the investigator, the investigator's designee, or by a qualified dental professional [dental hygienist or dentist]), including history of dental surgery (e.g., extraction or implant) within 8 weeks prior to registration and recorded on the dental exam checklist; Note: If the patient has received prior oral bisphosphonate therapy and has had a prior dental evaluation within 8 weeks of registration, the evaluation should not be repeated.

2.4 Complete blood count (CBC)/differential within 2 weeks prior to registration, with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows:

White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2400 cells/mm^3;
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3;
Platelets ≥ 60,000 cells/mm3;

≥ 18 years of age;
Zubrod performance status 0-2 for patients with breast or prostate primaries; Zubrod performance status 0-1 for patients with lung primaries;
Patients receiving systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy are eligible for this study. See Sections 6.0 and 7.0 for further details. Note: All patients must complete external beam radiation therapy ≥ 14 days prior to registration. If patients have undergone CyberKnife treatment, treatment must be completed ≥ 14 days prior to registration.
Patients may have received prior oral bisphosphonate therapy, such as Fosamax® or similar medications. Duration of bisphosphonate treatment prior to study entry must be documented, and all bisphosphonates other than the study drug must be discontinued prior to registration.
Women of childbearing potential and male participants must agree to practice an adequate means of birth control throughout their participation in the study.
Patient must sign study specific informed consent prior to study entry.

Exclusion Criteria

Patients with brain metastases and/or spinal cord compression are excluded. Note: Patients with no evidence of disease in the brain after treatment for brain metastases are eligible.
Patients with painful bone metastases are not permitted until these bone metastases are successfully treated (for example by external beam irradiation) prior to registration, and the patient has stable pain for at least 2 weeks after that treatment (Stable pain is defined for this study as a patient response of 1, 2, or 3 on Questions 4 and 5 of The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).
Prior treatment with Strontium-89 or Samarium-153 for bone metastases.
Treatment for more than 6 months with IV bisphosphonates prior to study entry;
Treatment with calcitonin, mithramycin, or gallium nitrate within 2 weeks prior to registration

Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

6.1 Evidence in the six months prior to study entry of uncontrolled congestive heart failure, hypertension refractory to treatment, or symptomatic coronary artery disease; 6.2 Current, active dental problems within 4 weeks of registration, including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or mandible); dental or fixture trauma; current or prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ); exposed bone in the mouth; or slow healing after dental procedures; 6.3 Dental surgery (e.g., extractions, implants) within 6 weeks of study entry and while receiving study treatment; for patients who require dental surgery, there are no data to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) [see Section 7.2.4].

6.4 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.

Pregnant or lactating patients are excluded, as treatment may be harmful to embryos and/or nursing infants.</FieldValue>

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Replication-incompetent viral, mRNA, subunit, conjugate, and toxoid vaccines are allowed.
COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic consideration: The COVID-19 vaccination should not be delayed; however, caution should be exercised when combining vaccination with cancer therapy, particularly immunotherapy. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause transient lymphadenopathy and potentially impact assessment of disease burden during screening and/or on-study. To allow correct interpretation and reduce equivocal findings, investigators should discuss with the participant appropriate timing and selection of anatomic site of vaccination (alternative) with respect to imaging scans (MRI or CT). Screening scans should be acquired before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or 4-6 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Because cancer patients are considered vulnerable population, after COVID-19 vaccination there is also a potential for heightened immune related adverse events including CRS. Investigators should use judgement when evaluating and managing potentially overlapping adverse events and in establishing causality with the study treatment (Schönrich and Raftery 2019; Desai et al. 2021; Edmonds et al. 2021; Indini et al. 2021)

        <FieldValue>The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn the safety and effects of the study medicine (PF-07799544) administered as a single agent and in combination with other study medications in people with solid tumors. This study is seeking participants who have an advanced solid tumor for which the available treatments are no longer effective in controlling their cancer. All participants in this study will receive PF-07799544. PF-07799544 comes as a tablet to take by mouth daily (initially 2 times per day, but this could change to once daily or another frequency). Depending on the part of the study, participants may also receive another study medicine.

In the first part of the study, people with melanoma or other solid tumors may also receive encorafenib. Encorafenib comes as a capsule and is taken once per day.
In the second part of the study, people with melanoma with a certain type of abnormal gene called &quot;BRAF&quot; will receive PF-07799544 with other study medicines (for example, PF-07284890 or PF-07799933).

Participants may receive the study medicines for about 2 years. The study team will monitor how each participant is doing with the study treatment during regular visits at the study clinic.</FieldValue>

In the opinion of the treating physician, the patient has adequate organ function to tolerate ulixertinib as defined in section 6.1
Male or female patients aged ≥ 12 years.

Patient must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication.

Note: Ulixertinib is primarily absorbed in the duodenum and therefore patients with any prior stomach or duodenal resection should be evaluated with that understanding.

For females, evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for pre-menopausal patients.
Highly effective contraception for both male and female patients throughout the treatment and for at least 4 months after last treatment administration. In patients under the age of 18, who are not sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form.
Toxicities related to any prior treatments are either stable, stable on supportive therapy, resolved, or in the opinion of the treating physician, clinically non-significant
Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it. Assent will be obtained when appropriate based on the patient's age.

Exclusion Criteria:

Patient is already participating in or qualifies for and is able to enroll in a clinical trial of ulixertinib (BVD-523).
Patient has received systemic therapy with an investigational agent within 5 half-lives or 14 days prior to starting ulixertinib treatment, whichever is shorter.
Patient has received radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of ulixertinib treatment other than for the allowable treatment of symptomatic bone metastasis.
A history of current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR)
Current evidence of uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness that would, in the treating physician's judgment, contraindicate the patient's treatment with ulixertinib due to safety concerns.

Known hypersensitivity to ulixertinib or any component in its formulation.

Patients taking prohibited medications as described in current Investigator's Brochure.

Note: Patients who require treatment with Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (see Appendix 3) were excluded from the FIH study of ulixertinib and should be discussed with xCures to review if any potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

Patient is actively breastfeeding.
Prior stomach or duodenal resection that in the opinion of the treating physician would affect the breakdown and absorption of ulixertinib.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up study of MGD009 administered intravenously (IV) on an every-other-week schedule for up to one year (14 cycles).

The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD009 and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD). This phase will enroll patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

In the cohort expansion phase, 6 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of MGD009 administered at the MTD/MAD dose in patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC, or other specific tumors that express high levels of B7-H3. Pre- and on-study biopsies are required for melanoma patients in the cohort expansion phase. Two additional cohorts (up to15 patients each) will evaluate the use of prophylaxis therapies to mitigate toxicity.

The survival follow-up phase consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study drug.

All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion administered to adult patients with advanced malignancies. Patients will be administered escalating doses of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion intradermally or subcutaneously in accordance with the following regimen: once weekly for four weeks during the Induction Phase, once every 7 to 14 days for 6 weeks during the Consolidation Phase, and once every 14 to 28 days until a discontinuation criterion is met during the Maintenance Phase. Once RP2D is determined from either the intradermal or subcutaneous group, an additional 40 patients evaluable for response may be enrolled as an expansion cohort at this dose and route of administration to confirm safety and tolerability. Separate from the dose-ascending cohort and RP2D expansion cohort described previously, and once the intradermal dose-ascending cohort is completed, up to 20 MDS patients who are refractory to treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) will be enrolled into an MDS expansion cohort. Of these 20 MDS patients, one-half will receive DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg according to the modified schedule employed in Phase 1 (every week for 4 weeks, every 2 weeks until Week 24, and then every 4 weeks; [MDS Cohort 1]). The other half of the MDS patients will receive DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg in an alternative dosing schedule where DSP-7888 is administered every 2 weeks until Week 24, after which it will be administered every 4 weeks (MDS Cohort 2).</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This study is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of a novel fragment crystallizable (Fc)-engineered immunoglobulin G1 anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) human monoclonal antibody (botensilimab) monotherapy and in combination with an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody (balstilimab), and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will also determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of botensilimab monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This Phase 1 study will enroll up to approximately 450 evaluable adult participants with refractory cancer (solid tumors) regardless of diagnosis.

The study will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation. Different dose levels of botensilimab, both monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab, will be evaluated in individual cohorts based upon dose. Each participant will remain in the cohort of the dose level and schedule assigned at study entry. Participants can be replaced for any reason other than a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Participants will receive treatment for ≤ 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial occurs.

Additionally, the study is intended to further explore the safety, PK, PD, and clinical activity in selected cancer types at dose levels (botensilimab monotherapy and combination therapy with balstilimab) determined as potentially effective. Indications of interest include, but are not limited to, non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, angiosarcoma, colorectal cancer without liver metastases, prostate cancer, and fibrolamellar carcinoma.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The study intervention consists of the early integration of palliative care services into standard oncology care in an outpatient setting for patients with advanced lung and non-colorectal gastrointestinal malignancies who are not being treated with curative intent. The palliative care services provided to patients randomized to the intervention will be provided by board-certified physicians and/or advanced practice nurses and will focus on the following areas: (1) developing and maintaining the therapeutic relationship with the patients and family caregivers; (2) assessing and treating patient symptoms; (3) providing support and reinforcement of coping with advanced cancer in patients and family caregivers; (4) assessing and enhancing prognostic awareness and illness understanding in patients and family caregivers; (5) assisting with treatment decision-making; and (6) end-of-life care planning.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>There will be about 400 patients enrolled in this intervention study and there will be about 300 family caregivers enrolled as well. This study will consist of two study groups as previously described. The effects of the early involvement of the palliative care team will be compared to the usual approach of receiving care mostly from the cancer treatment team. The stratification factors include tumor type (lung vs. esophageal/gastric vs. hepatic/biliary/pancreatic) and family care giver participation (yes vs. no). Patients will be on this study for as long as they receive care. Institutions must have an outpatient palliative care clinic that meets the study site requirements as defined in the protocol. The outpatient clinic leadership must include a physician and/or advanced practice nurses board certified in palliative care. The primary and secondary endpoints are described below.

Primary Endpoint:

To determine the efficacy of early integrated palliative care on patient reported quality of life at 12 weeks using the FACT in patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancer

Secondary Endpoints:

To determine the efficacy of early integrated palliative care on other patient reported outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancer, by assessing the endpoints defined in the protocol
To determine the efficacy of early integrated palliative care on family caregiver reported outcomes in those newly diagnosed incurable lung or non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancer, by assessing the endpoints defined in the protocol
To assess the impact of early integrated palliative care on the quality of end-of-life care and resource utilization in patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancer by assessing the endpoints defined in the protocol
To determine concordance between patient and family caregiver report of prognosis/ curability</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>TC-510 is a novel cell therapy that consists of autologous genetically engineered T cells expressing two synthetic constructs: first, a single-domain antibody that recognizes human Mesothelin, fused to the CD3-epsilon subunit which, upon expression, is incorporated into the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) complex and second, a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the T cell, independently from the TCR. The PD-1:CD28 switch receptor comprises the PD-1 extracellular domain fused to the CD28 intracellular domain via a transmembrane domain. Thus, the switch is designed to produce a costimulatory signal upon engagement with PD-L1 on cancer cells.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This trial collects multiple tissue and blood samples, along with medical information, from cancer patients. The &quot;Cancer Moonshot Biobank&quot; is a longitudinal study. This means it collects and stores samples and information over time, throughout the course of a patient's cancer treatment. By looking at samples and information collected from the same people over time, researchers hope to better understand how cancer changes over time and over the course of medical treatments.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To support current and future investigations into drug resistance and sensitivity and other National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored cancer research initiatives through the procurement and distribution of multiple longitudinal biospecimens and associated data from a diverse group of cancer patients who are undergoing standard of care treatment at NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites and other National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) sites.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To provide a service of value to study participants and their medical providers through the performance of molecular profiling assays on tumor samples in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory and reporting of results to physicians and patients that they may opt to use in clinical management, including analysis of data for acquired resistance mechanisms.

II. To enable the development of patient-derived models such as cell lines and xenografts for cancer researchers through the provision of biospecimens from up to 20% of study participants to the NCI's Patient Derived Models Repository (PDMR), a national resource available to investigators.

III. To develop and implement robust approaches in patient and provider engagement to improve understanding of biobanking and its relationship to cancer research and increase representation of minority and underserved study participants in cancer research.

IV. To develop increased capabilities in United States (U.S.) community hospitals and clinics for contribution to cancer research through biobanking activities.

V. To enable secondary research generated from the project through deposition of data in public repositories such as Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP), including clinical, radiology and pathology data with an emphasis on treatment response and outcome data.

VI. To provide residual biospecimens and associated data from the project to the cancer research community.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, post treatment and at disease progression. Patients with hematological malignancies also undergo collection of bone marrow and cerebral spinal fluid at the same time points. Archival blood and tissue, as well as bone marrow of patients with hematological malignancies, is also collected, if available. Patient medical records are reviewed, and data is collected for at least 5 years.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This trial studies treatment effects on development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer. Treatments for cancer can cause a problem to the nervous system (called peripheral neuropathy) that can lead to tingling or less feeling in hands and feet. Studying certain risk factors, such as age, gender, pre-existing conditions, and the type of treatment for cancer may help doctors estimate how likely patients are to develop the nerve disorder.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To develop and validate a clinical risk prediction model using clinical factors for the development of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy regimens.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective measures of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to better define the phenotype of peripheral neuropathy in this patient population.

II. To assess the incidence of CIPN within one year in this patient population. III. To identify predictors of treatment dose reductions, delays, and discontinuations associated with CIPN symptoms in this patient population.

OTHER OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect serum and plasma samples for future testing for biomarker and mechanistic studies of CIPN.

Patients must be planning to start treatment with a taxane-based chemotherapy as part of one of the study-approved taxane regimens (docetaxel chemotherapy regimens for treatment of breast or ovarian cancer, or paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen for treatment of breast, non-small cell lung, or ovarian cancer) within 14 days after registration. (Note that docetaxel or paclitaxel may be administered with a non-neurotoxic chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, and/or biologic agent, such as trastuzumab, and/or carboplatin. Additionally, nab-paclitaxel may not be substituted for paclitaxel for purposes of this study.)
Patients who will receive treatment in the setting of any other clinical trial are eligible as long as it is one of the study-approved regimens. Patients may receive additional treatments (i.e., experimental therapy, immunotherapy, biologics, etc.) as part of another clinical trial in addition to any regimen approved in this study.
Patients must not have received a taxane (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or protein-bound paclitaxel), platinum (cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin), vinca alkaloid (vinblastine, vincristine, or vinorelbine), or bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimen prior to registration. (Note that while patients must not have received carboplatin in the past, patients may receive a carboplatin-containing regimen after registration as part of the docetaxel or paclitaxel regimen.)

Patients who can complete Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments in English or Spanish must:

Agree to complete PROs at all scheduled assessments
Complete the baseline PRO forms prior to registration
Patients with pre-existing neuropathy are eligible, including those with diabetes and neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson?s disease.
Patients must agree to submit required specimens for defined translational medicine.
Patients must be offered the opportunity to submit additional optional specimens for future, unspecified translational medicine and banking. With patient?s consent, specimens must be submitted.
Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
As a part of the OPEN registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to assess long-term safety and provide continued study treatment access to eligible participants who are judged by the Investigator to benefit from continued treatment with capmatinib monotherapy or in combination with other treatments or with the combination treatment alone in a Novartis sponsored study</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This is an open-label, multi-center, rollover study to assess long-term safety in participants who have completed a prior Novartis-sponsored study, that have fulfilled the eligibility requirements and are judged by the Investigator to benefit from continued treatment with capmatinib given as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments or with the combination treatment alone.

There will be no screening period for this study. After providing informed consent, all eligible participants will begin their treatment within the rollover study. Participants should return to the study center for resupply of the study medication/s and for safety assessment following the usual local practice. During a public health emergency as declared by local or regional authorities (i.e. pandemic, epidemic or natural disaster) that limits or prevents on-site study visits, alternative methods of providing continuing care may be implemented by the Investigator as the situation dictates.

Participants will continue to be treated until they are no longer benefitting from the study treatment in the opinion of the treating physician, develop unacceptable toxicities that preclude further treatment with the study treatment, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation at the discretion of the Investigator, initiation of new anticancer therapy, until the study treatment is commercially available and reimbursed or/and available under any other local mechanism (such as compassionate use, named patient program) for the appropriate indication and/or discontinuation for any other reason. Participants receiving capmatinib as part of a combination therapy could continue treatment only with capmatinib or with the combination treatment as single agent in case one of the two compounds is permanently discontinued, if in the opinion of the treating physician they are still benefitting from the treatment.

A patient will reach the end of rollover study when study treatment is permanently discontinued and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All participants will be followed up for safety for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until SAE is resolved as required, whichever is later.

The study is expected to remain open for up to 10 years or until such time that all enrolled participants no longer need treatment with study treatment(s) or Novartis decides to stop the development program, whichever comes first.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Inclusion criteria:

Participant is currently receiving capmatinib treatment (within Novartis-sponsored study which is eligible and approved to transition participants to rollover study) as single agent or in combination or is receiving a combination treatment alone. This includes all participants treated with capmatinib in combination with other treatment that permanently discontinued capmatinib for any reason but are still receiving the combination treatment as single agent. In order to receive the combination treatment as single agent in the rollover study, the treatment needs to be not accessible to the participant outside a clinical trial (e.g. commercially not available or reimbursed).
Participant is currently deriving clinical benefit from study treatment as determined by the Investigator
Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures
Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in the rollover study and receiving study medication. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.

Exclusion criteria:

        <FieldValue>Testing the Addition of Whole Brain Radiotherapy Using a Technique That Avoids the Hippocampus to Stereotactic Radiosurgery in People With Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain and Come Back in Other Areas of the Brain After Earlier Stereotactic Radiosurgery</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase III trial compares the effect of adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery versus stereotactic radiosurgery alone in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain and come back in other areas of the brain after earlier stereotactic radiosurgery. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to the hippocampus, which is a brain structure that is important for memory. The medicine memantine is also often given with whole brain radiation therapy because it may decrease the risk of side effects of radiation on thinking and memory. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation only to the small areas of cancer in the brain and avoids the surrounding normal brain tissue. Adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing cancer that has spread to the brain and returned in other areas of the brain after receiving stereotactic radiosurgery.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance (HA-WBRT) in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs time to neurologic death as compared to salvage SRS alone.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs overall survival as compared to salvage SRS alone.

II. To evaluate if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs intracranial progression-free survival as compared to salvage SRS alone.

III. To evaluate if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS improves brain metastasis velocity at subsequent relapse as compared to salvage SRS alone.

IV. To assess perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities, symptom burden and health status after salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.

V. To compare neurocognitive function outcomes following salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.

VI. To tabulate and descriptively compare the adverse events associated with the interventions.

VII. To tabulate and descriptively compare the number of salvage procedures used to manage recurrent intracranial disease following the interventions.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect serum, plasma, and whole blood for translational research analyses.

II. To collect baseline and all follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hippocampal volume, memory center substructures, axial T2 volumes, and quantitative texture analysis.

III. To collect baseline and follow-up MR imaging to extract whole brain volume, white matter volume and volume of metastatic disease to correlate with cognitive change at 4 months.

IV. To evaluate dose-volume histogram parameters to correlate with radiation toxicity.

V. To assess in patients receiving immunotherapy or targeted therapy, if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS improves brain metastasis velocity and/or overall survival at subsequent relapse as compared to salvage SRS.

VI. To compare the estimated cost of brain-related therapies and quality-adjusted life years in patients who receive salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with metastasis velocity &gt;= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients undergo HA-WBRT daily (5 times weekly) for 2 weeks for a total of 10 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 1 week prior to or following HA-WBRT, patients undergo salvage SRS. Prior to HA-WBRT or no later than the 4th treatment, patients also receive memantine orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients undergo salvage SRS.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="EligibilityCriteria">
        <FieldValue>Inclusion Criteria:

Patients must have developed their first or second distant brain relapse(s) at least 8 weeks after upfront SRS and within 21 days prior to randomization

Distant brain relapse lesions to be treated must measure =&lt; 3.0 cm in maximal extent and total volume of distant brain relapses to be treated must measure &lt; 30 mL on the contrast-enhanced diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan obtained within 21 days prior to randomization

Distant brain relapse lesions must be diagnosed on MRI, which will include the following elements:

REQUIRED MRI ELEMENTS

Post gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient (SPGR). Acceptable 3D SPGR sequences include magnetization-prepared 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), turbo field echo (TFE) MRI, BRAVO (brain volume imaging) or 3D fast FE (field echo). The T1-weighted 3D scan should use the smallest possible axial slice thickness, not to exceed 1.5 mm
Pre-contrast T1 weighted imaging (3D imaging sequence strongly encouraged)
A minimum of one axial T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (preferred) or T2 sequence is required. This can be acquired as a 2D or 3D image. If 2D, the images should be obtained in the axial plane

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation is that an axial T2 FLAIR (preferred) sequence be performed instead of a T2 sequence
Recommendation is that that pre-contrast 3D T1 be performed with the same parameters as the post-contrast 3D T1
Recommendation is that imaging be performed on a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI
Recommendation is that the study participants be scanned on the same MRI instrument at each time point
Recommendation is that if additional sequences are obtained, these should meet the criteria outlined in Kaufmann et al., 2020
If additional sequences are obtained, total imaging time should not exceed 60 minutes
Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) since upfront SRS must be &gt;= 4 brain metastases/year
The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry

Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or gastrointestinal cancer within 10 years prior to randomization.

Other histologies are not permitted
History and physical examination within 28 days prior to randomization
Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70 within 28 days prior to randomization
Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 30 ml/min (within 28 days prior to randomization)
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (e.g., if the ULN is 20 mg/dL, then BUN up to 30 mg/dL is permitted) (within 28 days prior to randomization)
Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential) within 14 days prior to randomization

Exclusion Criteria:

Prior WBRT or prophylactic cranial irradiation

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This phase I trial identifies the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of BAY 1895344 in combination with chemotherapy in treating patients with solid tumors or urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). BAY 1895344 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cisplatin and gemcitabine are chemotherapy drugs that stop the growth of tumor cells by killing the cells. Combining BAY 1895344 with chemotherapy treatment (cisplatin, or cisplatin and gemcitabine) may be effective for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including urothelial cancer.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin + elimusertib (BAY 1895344) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

II. To establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY 1895344 in patients with advanced solid tumors with an emphasis on urothelial carcinoma (UC).

III. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of cisplatin + BAY 1895344 and cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY 1895344.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of BAY 1895344 (in the doublet and triplet combinations) and gemcitabine (in the triplet) in combination with cisplatin.

II. To further evaluate the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY 1895344 in patients with UC.

III. To evaluate preliminary efficacy observed with cisplatin + BAY 1895344 and cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY 1895344 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including UC.

IV. To monitor for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.

V. To evaluate the association between ATM expression by immunohistochemical staining and responses to therapy.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the correlation of biomarkers, including deleterious deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response (DDR) gene alterations and circulating tumor (ct)DNA with responses to therapy using whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA seq) analysis of archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, as well as blood.

II. To correlate drug exposure with response and/or toxicity.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of elimusertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I (DOUBLET COMBINATION): Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1 and 8, and elimusertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2 and 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II (TRIPLET COMBINATION): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and 8, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and elimusertib PO QD on days 2 and 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months thereafter.</FieldValue>

For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated
Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.
Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression
Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy; patients with stable brain metastases that are asymptomatic and on a stable dose of steroids are also considered eligible
Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better
The effects of BAY 1895344, cisplatin, and gemcitabine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344 administration
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

Exclusion Criteria:

Life expectancy &lt; 6 weeks by investigator assessment
Other active malignancy requiring treatment, except for cutaneous malignancies that require resection such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or cutaneous melanoma, and except for prostate cancer if only on androgen deprivation therapy
Significant peripheral neuropathy (grade 2 or higher by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE])

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to BAY 1895344 or other agents used in study
Patients receiving any medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic window, or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if they cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness
Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 as a DNA-damage response inhibitor, cisplatin, and gemcitabine may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 1895344 breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 1895344 and for 4 months after end of treatment. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Zoledronate may help to relieve some of the symptoms caused by bone metastases. It is not yet known if zoledronate is more effective than no further therapy in relieving symptoms of bone metastases or preventing disease progression.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of zoledronate in treating patients who have solid tumors that have spread to the bone.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of zoledronate in patients with any solid tumor cancer with bone metastases other than breast or prostate cancer. II. Assess the efficacy of zoledronate in preventing skeletal-related events including tumor induced hypercalcemia (TIH), time to first occurrence of skeletal-related event or TIH, skeletal morbidity rate, time to progression of bone metastases, overall survival, and time to overall disease progression in these patients. III. Assess the quality of life and pain in these patients on these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified into two groups: patients with lung cancer and patients with all other solid tumor cancers. Patients are randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following treatments: Arm I: Patients receive intravenous zoledronate over 5 minutes every 3 weeks for 9 months. Arm II: Patients receive intravenous zoledronate at a higher dose over 5 minutes every 3 weeks for 9 months. Arm III: Patients receive intravenous placebo over 5 minutes every 3 weeks for 9 months. All patients receive oral calcium daily, and an oral multivitamin supplement. Quality of life is assessed prior to therapy, then at months 3, 6, and 9. Patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This open-label, First-into-Human (FIH) study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and early efficacy of AVA6000, a FAP-activated pro-drug of doxorubicin, in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumours. In Phase Ia, using a 3+3 design, escalating doses of AVA6000 will be administered to patients with a range of solid tumour types to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). In Phase 1b, the selected RP2D dose will be assessed in one to three tumour types.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study investigating AVA6000 monotherapy administered intravenously (IV) in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic solid tumours.

The study will be conducted in two parts: Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) and Phase 1b (Dose Expansion):

Phase 1a (Dose Escalation): The dose-escalation phase is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and MTD and/or RP2D of AVA6000, administered as monotherapy

Phase 1b (Dose Expansion): The dose-expansion phase will comprise 1 to 3 expansion arms in specific tumour types to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVA6000 at the MTD or RP2D when administered as monotherapy. The tumour types to be explored in Phase 1b, will be determined based on evaluation of the Phase 1a data and the protocol will be amended accordingly.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called BT8009 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression or in participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies having renal insufficiency.

The main goals of this study are to:

Find the recommended dose of BT8009 that can be given safely to participants alone and in combination with pembrolizumab
Learn more about the side effects and effectiveness of BT8009 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab
Learn more about BT8009 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab
Learn more about BT8009 alone in patients with renal insufficiency</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>BT8009 consists of a bicyclic peptide (Bicycle®) which binds selectively to Nectin-4 covalently attached to a spacer and a val-cit cleavable linker attached to a cytotoxin (MMAE).

This study is a Phase I/II, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study of BT8009 given as a single agent in 3 different dosing schedules- weekly (28 day cycle), biweekly (28 day cycle) , dosing on day 1 and day 8 of a 3-weekly cycle and in combination with pembrolizumab. There are three parts to this study. Part A is a dose escalation in patients with select advanced solid tumors primarily designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of BT8009 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab and to determine a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following a selection of an RP2D, part B, a dose expansion portion, will be initiated with the primary objective of clinical activity of BT8009 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with select advanced solid tumors. Part C will evaluate safety and tolerability of RP2D in patients with renal insufficiency.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>This study was to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001 to adult patients with solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation (phase 1) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001, and a dose expansion (phase 2) which characterized treatment of LAG525 in combination with PDR001 at the MTD or RP2D.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This was a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study comprising a Phase 1 dose escalation part followed by a Phase 2 dose expansion part.

During the Phase 1 dose escalation part patients with any advanced solid tumor received the study treatment until the MTD was reached or a lower RP2D was established. The study had the following 3 dose escalation parts: 1) Single-agent LAG525; 2) Single-agent LAG525 in Japanese patients; 3) Combination of LAG525 with PDR001.

Once the RP2D or MTD had been determined in the escalation parts, additional patients were to be enrolled in the Phase 2 expansion parts in order to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity. Phase 2 expansion cohorts testing single-agent LAG525 were not opened for enrollment based on emerging data including but not limited to preliminary anti-tumor activity. Phase 2 expansion cohorts for the combination of LAG525 with PDR001 were opened and 5 tumor types were assessed: 1) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 2) Melanoma; 3) Renal cell cancer (RCC); 4) Mesothelioma; 5) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The efficacy and safety of the combination of LAG525 with PDR001 in these tumor types was assessed in both the PD-1/PD-L1 pre-treated and naïve settings.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this study is to assess if Gtx-024 is effective in increasing lean body mass in subjects with muscle wasting related to cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>Cancer cachexia is characterized by a hypermetabolic state that leads to catabolism that is responsible for reductions in lean mass.These catabolic changes are accompanied by an increase in total energy expenditure, but a decrease in voluntary energy expenditure that ultimately results clinically in cachexia and its symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, weakness and general malaise (Kotler DP. Cachexia. Ann Intern Med. 2000; 133:622-634).

The prevalence of cachexia increases from 50 percent at presentation to more than 80 percent before death from malignancy. In over 20 percent of cancer patients, cachexia is the cause of death (Bruera E. Anorexia, cachexia and nutrition. Br Med J 1997;315:1219-1222). Cancer cachexia leads to shorter survival, decreased response rates and increased toxicity to chemotherapy, weakness, and an overall decreased quality of life (DeWys et al. Prognostic effect of weight loss prior to chemotherapy in cancer patients. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Am J Med. 1980 Oct;69(4):491-7). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of GTx-024 on total body lean mass. Secondary endpoints include but are not limited to assessment of GTx-024 on muscle function, total body weight and total body fat mass.</FieldValue>

Phase 1 consisted of a 3 + 3 + 3 design intended to determine the MTD or PAD of epacadostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy; efficacy was also explored.

Phase 2 was designed to enroll efficacy expansion cohorts to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of epacadostat at the MTD or PAD (as selected in Phase 1) when given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. Each efficacy expansion cohort was to enroll participants with 1 specific type of advanced or metastatic solid tumor. Additional cohorts (ie, the mandatory biopsy cohorts) were designed to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment in participants with any advanced or metastatic solid tumor who had progressed on previous therapy with a PD-1 or a PD-L1 inhibitor.

No participants were enrolled in any Phase 2 efficacy expansion cohort, or in any Phase 2 mandatory biopsy cohort receiving Treatment A, B, F, or G. Phase 2 mandatory biopsy cohort participants received Treatments C, D, or E (ie, were included in Treatment Groups C, D, or E).

      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel and cisplatin plus radiation therapy followed by filgrastim in treating patients who have recurrent head and neck cancer or lung cancer.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with locally recurrent carcinoma of the head and neck or lung treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy followed by filgrastim (G-CSF). II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression and the sites and pattern of progression in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the median, 1-year, and 2-year survival rates of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck vs salivary gland malignancy or other non-squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck vs lung cancer). Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 30-120 minutes on days 1-5. Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily on days 1-5.

        <FieldValue>This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of ABM-1310 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have no effective standard treatment options available, as monotherapy in patients with documented BRAF V600 mutation, or in combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic®) in adult patients who have documented BRAF mutation and progressive disease or intolerance to at least one prior line of systemic therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of both single agent and combination treatment and to assess the safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 as a monotherapy and in combination.

Study consists of three Parts:

Part A: The starting dose of ABM-1310 is 25 mg po bid, and dose escalation will be guided by a &quot;3+3&quot; design. ABM-1310 will be administered twice daily on a continuous schedule. Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days.

Part B: The starting dose of ABM-1310 will be a dose below the MTD that has been demonstrated to be safe in Part A Monotherapy. A classic &quot;3+3&quot; design will guide the dose escalation. At each dose level, ABM-1310 will be administered in combination with 60 mg cobimetinib (Cotellic ®) once daily (qd) for the first 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle.

Part C:

In C-1 (Monotherapy - Primary CNS Tumors) and C-2 (Monotherapy - Advanced or Metastatic solid tumors excluding Primary CNS tumors with or without Brain Metastasis), continuous twice daily oral doses of ABM-1310 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) from Part A until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal criterion is met.
In C-3 (Combination therapy - Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors including Primary CNS Tumors but excluding Melanoma with Brain Metastsis) and C-4 (Combination therapy - Melanoma with Brain Metastasis), continuous twice daily oral doses of ABM-1310 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) from Part B, in combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic®) 60 mg administered the first 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal criterion is met.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated and managed per the pre-defined DLT criteria and rules specified in the protocol. MTD and/or RP2D will be confirmed in a dose confirmation cohort.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of CDX-1401 when given in combination with an immune stimulant (resiquimod) to patients with advanced cancers that are known to express the NY-ESO-1 protein.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>NY-ESO-1 is a protein that is often made by some types of tumor cells, but only made by a few types of normal cells. Because it is primarily made by cancer cells, the NY-ESO-1 protein is a promising target against which to stimulate an immune response that may destroy cancer cells. CDX-1401 is a cancer vaccine that is specially designed to create this type of immune response. To enhance the immune response, CDX-1401 will be given with 1 or 2 immune stimulants called Resiquimod and poly-ICLC (Hiltonol).

This clinical trial includes Phase 1 and Phase 2 segments. During the Phase 1 segment, six groups of 6 to 24 patients will be treated with different dose levels of CDX-1401 in combination with either one or both of the immune stimulants (Resiquimod and/or poly-ICLC). This phase of the study will test the safety profile of the vaccine treatment, and will assess which dose to test in future studies. During the Phase 2 segment, 14 patients whose cancer tested positive for the NY-ESO-1 protein in laboratory testing, will receive the study treatment to determine if it has an effect on their cancer. All patients enrolled in either part of the study may continue to receive study treatment until their disease has progressed or until it is necessary to stop the treatment for safety or other reasons. In addition, all patients will be &quot;followed&quot; for 24 months after enrollment in order to collect survival information.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>A Study of BDTX-189, an Orally Available Allosteric ErbB Inhibitor, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>This is a clinical study with an orally administered drug, BDTX-189 in participants with advanced solid tumors that have select mutations or alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB2) genes or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1). The main goals of this study are to:

Find the recommended dose of BDTX-189 that can be given safely to participants
Learn more about the side effects of BDTX-189
Learn what the body does to BDTX-189 after it has been taken (pharmacokinetics or PK)
Determine the antitumor activity of BDTX-189 in participants with select allosteric ErbB gene mutations</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>BDTX-189 is an irreversible, small molecular inhibitor that is highly selective versus wild-type EGFR and potent for cancer driver mutations of the ErbB family, including extracellular, transmembrane, and kinase domain allosteric mutations of HER2, as well as EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. These allosteric ErbB mutations are found in 1 - 2 % of most solid tumors and enriched in some cancers with a prevalence of about 2 - 7% such as in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and endometrial cancer. Currently approved HER2 and EGFR directed therapies are not active against the spectrum of allosteric mutations at relevant and tolerated exposure levels.

This Phase 1/2 multi-center, open-label trial is a first-in-human study that will evaluate BDTX-189 orally administered daily as a single agent in patients with solid tumors harboring select mutations or alterations. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of BDTX-189 and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 1 will focus on patients with a solid tumor with alterations such as:

Allosteric HER2 or HER3 mutation(s)
EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation(s)
HER2 amplified or overexpressing tumors
EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation

Following selection of the RP2D, a Phase 2 portion will be initiated to further evaluate the clinical activity of BDTX-189. Phase 2 will focus on patients with a solid tumor harboring an:

Allosteric HER2 mutation (including but not limited to S310F/Y, R678Q, L755S/P, V777L, V842I)
EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation

Eligible mutations must be determined by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) test routinely used by each institution and performed in a CLIA-certified or equivalent laboratory.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>Counseling and Nicotine Replacement Therapy in Helping Adult Smokers Quit Smoking</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="BriefSummary">
        <FieldValue>RATIONALE: Stop-smoking plans, including counseling and nicotine replacement therapy, may help smokers quit smoking. It is not yet known whether counseling and the nicotine lozenge is more effective than counseling and the nicotine patch in helping adult smokers quit smoking.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying counseling and the nicotine lozenge to see how well they work compared to counseling and the nicotine patch in helping smokers quit smoking.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Compare the efficacy of behavioral counseling and nicotine-replacement therapy with either oral nicotine lozenge (NL) or transdermal nicotine patch (NP), in terms of promoting rates of smoking cessation (e.g., continued abstinence), in adult smokers.
Examine the degree to which nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) preference, desire to control NRT dosing, irregular smoking schedules, and desire for oral preoccupation moderates the relative efficacy of NL vs NP in promoting smoking cessation.
Evaluate the impact of the NL on mediators of smoking cessation (i.e., reduced craving, diminished withdrawal symptoms, cue reactivity, and increased perceived control over withdrawal symptoms).

Secondary

Compare the rate of compliance with NRT across the 2 treatment arms and examine if compliance rate mediates the effects of NRT on quit rates.
Examine the potential role of genes related to nicotine dependence such as genes related to nicotine metabolism enzymes (e.g., CYP1A1) or genes related to dopamine concentrations (e.g., DRD2).

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to study center. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

All participants undergo smoking cessation counseling in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Beginning in week 3, participants are asked to quit smoking for 12 weeks (weeks 3-14).

Arm I: Participants apply a transdermal nicotine patch at 3 different time periods during weeks 3-14; a higher-dose patch is applied for weeks 3-8, a medium-dose patch is applied for weeks 9-10, and a lower-dose patch is applied for weeks 11-14.
Arm II: Participants receive one oral nicotine lozenge every 1-2 hours in weeks 3-8 (≥ 9 lozenges per day), one lozenge every 2-4 hours in weeks 9-11 (≥ 5 lozenges per day), and 1 lozenge every 4-8 hours in weeks 12-14 (≥ 3 lozenges per day).

The moderating variables (e.g., nicotine replacement-therapy [NRT] preference and the smoker's desire to control NRT dosing) are assessed at baseline. The mediating variables (i.e., reduced craving, diminished withdrawal symptoms, cue reactivity, and increased perceived control over withdrawal symptoms) are assessed at baseline and then at weeks 5, 7, 9, within weeks 14-16, and within weeks 26-28. Continuous abstinence will be measured at week 27.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 participants will be accrued for this study.</FieldValue>

      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>This is a 2-part, Phase 1/2, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multiple-dose and dose-escalation study of intravenous (directly into a vein) siltuximab in participants with malignant solid tumors. The study tests the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug, siltuximab, in participants with advanced cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body). This study also tests how siltuximab is cleared from the body and how the body reacts to it. For this reason blood tests will be performed and some characteristics of the tumor will be analyzed. Siltuximab will be given by intravenous infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over 1 hour. In Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) doses will be administered in a range of 2.8-15 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg). Cohort 5 of Phase 1 will receive the recommended dose and schedule as determined from Cohort 1-4. Participants in Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) will receive 4 administrations of siltuximab over a 10-13 week period, while participants in Cohort 5 and Phase 2 will receive 12 administrations over a 33 week period. Follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after last dose will be scheduled. Participants may then be contacted for up to 1 year after the last dose for follow-up survival and disease status information. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored at every visit.</FieldValue>

        <FieldValue>To determine if the regorafenib and nivolumab combination (RegoNivo) improves overall survival compared with current standard chemotherapy options in refractory AGOC.</FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <FieldValues Field="DetailedDescription">
        <FieldValue>The purpose of this international study is to determine if the combination of regorafenib and nivolumab is more effective than standard chemotherapy in prolonging overall survival in a broad group of participants with AGOC, who have progressed after treatment with standard anti-cancer therapy.

In the INTEGRATE study, regorafenib alone was shown to be effective in prolonging the progression-free period in people with AGOC following standard anti-cancer therapy (i.e. it delayed tumour growth), and demonstrated a potential benefit on long term survival. Recent research has shown the early results from this combination of regorafenib &amp; nivolumab may improve outcomes for cancer patients. INTEGRATE IIb will investigate this effect further in a larger group of participants with AGOC.

The study aims to determine:

i. Whether the combination of regorafenib/nivolumab is likely to help patients with AGOC live longer; ii. The effects of this treatment on progression-free survival; iii. The numbers of participants responding to the treatment iv. The effects of this treatment on quality of life v. The side effects and tolerability of this treatment vi. Molecular differences (e.g. variations in genes or proteins) that may account for the effects of this treatment vii. Differences in the costs of care for people on this treatment.

The Investigators plan to enrol 450 participants in the study from, but not limited to; Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, USA, Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy.</FieldValue>
